            "marks": 4,
            "answer": "### Structure of Chloroplast\nChloroplasts are typically oval-shaped organelles found in plant and algal cells, enclosed by a **double membrane** (an outer and an inner membrane). The inner membrane surrounds a fluid-filled space called the **stroma**, which contains various enzymes, chloroplast DNA, ribosomes, and starch granules. Within the stroma, there is an internal membrane system composed of flattened sacs called **thylakoids**. Thylakoids are often stacked into structures called **grana** (singular: granum). The thylakoid membranes contain chlorophyll and other light-absorbing pigments, as well as electron transport chain components. Individual grana are connected by **stroma lamellae**.\n\n### Functions of Chloroplast\nThe primary function of chloroplasts is **photosynthesis**, the process that converts light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose.\n\n1.  **Light-Dependent Reactions:** These reactions occur on the thylakoid membranes. Chlorophyll captures light energy, exciting electrons. This energy drives the splitting of water molecules (photolysis), releasing oxygen, electrons, and protons. The energy from the excited electrons is then used to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate).\n2.  **Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle):** These reactions take place in the stroma. The ATP and NADPH produced during the light reactions provide the energy and reducing power to fix carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, converting it into glucose and other organic molecules. This process synthesizes carbohydrates that serve as the plant's energy source and building blocks.",

This means they can potentially form all cell types of the body, except for extra-embryonic tissues like the placenta.\n2.  **Self-renewal:** ESCs can proliferate indefinitely in vitro (in laboratory cultures) while maintaining their undifferentiated state, given appropriate culture conditions.\n\nESCs hold significant promise for regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and drug discovery due to their broad differentiation potential. However, their use is associated with considerable ethical debates, primarily concerning the destruction of human embryos for their derivation.",

It also prepares for DNA synthesis.\n2.  **S Phase (Synthesis):** The cell accurately replicates its entire genomic DNA. Each chromosome now consists of two identical sister chromatids.\n3.  **G2 Phase (Second Gap):** The cell continues to grow and synthesizes proteins and organelles essential for cell division. It also checks for any DNA damage or replication errors before entering the M (mitotic) phase.",

            "answer": "### Structural Genomics\nStructural genomics is a field that aims to determine the three-dimensional structures of all proteins encoded by a genome (the 'proteome'). Its primary goal is to provide a comprehensive structural catalog of an organism's proteins. This involves using high-throughput experimental techniques like X-ray crystallography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy, as well as computational modeling. By understanding the 3D structure of proteins, researchers can gain insights into their potential functions, identify binding sites, and inform drug design.\n\n### Functional Genomics\nFunctional genomics focuses on understanding the function of genes, transcripts (RNA), and proteins, and how they interact within an organism. Unlike structural genomics, which focuses on static structures, functional genomics aims to elucidate the dynamic processes of gene expression, regulation, and protein activity. Techniques used include transcriptomics (e.g., microarrays, RNA-seq to study gene expression levels), proteomics (e.g., mass spectrometry to study protein abundance, modifications, and interactions), and epigenomics (studying epigenetic modifications). The goal is to connect genetic information to biological phenotypes and understand cellular processes and disease mechanisms.",

            "answer": "The use of stem cells, particularly embryonic stem cells (ESCs), presents a complex array of ethical and legal issues due to their source and potential applications.\n\n### Ethical Issues:\n1.  **Status of the Embryo:** The most contentious ethical issue concerns the moral status of the human embryo. If an embryo is considered a human life, then its destruction for research purposes is seen as morally objectionable by some individuals and groups, particularly those with pro-life beliefs.\n2.  **Source of ESCs:** ESCs are typically derived from blastocysts created through in vitro fertilization (IVF) that are not used for reproductive purposes, or from embryos created via somatic cell nuclear transfer (therapeutic cloning). This raises questions about whether it is ethical to create or use embryos specifically for research, even if they would otherwise be discarded.\n3.  **Potential for Exploitation:** Concerns exist regarding the potential exploitation of women who donate eggs for research, or of donors of other biological materials used in stem cell derivation.\n4.  **Genetic Manipulation/Germline Editing:** The future possibility of using stem cells for germline gene editing, which would alter the genes passed on to future generations, raises profound ethical questions about unintended consequences, human identity, and the creation of 'designer babies'.\n5.  **Human-Animal Chimeras:** Research involving the creation of human-animal chimeras (e.g., injecting human stem cells into animal embryos for developmental studies) raises ethical dilemmas about blurring species boundaries and the moral status of such entities.\n\n### Legal Issues:\n1.  **Funding Restrictions:** Many countries and jurisdictions have enacted varying legal frameworks and policies regarding government funding for stem cell research, particularly ESC research. These restrictions often reflect the prevailing ethical debates within society.\n2.  **Embryo Research Legislation:** Laws differ widely globally concerning the creation, use, and destruction of human embryos for research. Some countries have outright bans, while others permit it under strict regulations, such as limits on the developmental stage of the embryo or requiring explicit consent from donors.\n3.  **Therapeutic vs. Reproductive Cloning:** Most nations have legally banned human reproductive cloning (creating a genetically identical human being). However, the legal status of therapeutic cloning (creating an embryo to derive stem cells for research) varies; some allow it under strict oversight.\n4.  **Informed Consent:** Legal requirements for obtaining fully informed consent from donors of gametes (eggs/sperm) or embryos for stem cell research are critical and must comply with human subjects research regulations.\n5.  **Patenting and Commercialization:** The patenting of stem cell lines, differentiation protocols, and stem cell-based therapies raises complex legal questions about intellectual property, ownership of biological materials, accessibility of treatments, and the commercialization of human life processes.",

            "question_text": "Justify why structure of a protein determines the function of the protein.",
            "marks": 16,
            "answer": "The principle that a protein's structure dictates its function is foundational to molecular biology. A protein's specific three-dimensional shape, arising from its unique amino acid sequence and subsequent folding, is precisely what enables it to perform its biological role. Any alteration to this structure can compromise or abolish its function. This relationship can be justified by several key points:\n\n1.  **Specific Binding Sites (Lock and Key Analogy):** Proteins primarily function through specific interactions with other molecules (ligands, substrates, other proteins). These interactions occur at precisely shaped binding sites or active sites on the protein surface. The unique 3D contour, charge distribution, and chemical properties of these sites are complementary to specific target molecules, much like a key fits a particular lock. Without the correct structure, the protein cannot bind its target efficiently or at all.\n\n2.  **Amino Acid Sequence (Primary Structure) as the Blueprint:** The linear sequence of amino acids (primary structure) in a polypeptide chain is the ultimate determinant of its final 3D structure. The diverse chemical properties of the 20 different amino acid side chains (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, acidic, basic, polar, nonpolar) dictate how the polypeptide will fold spontaneously into its most thermodynamically stable conformation. Even a single amino acid substitution (e.g., in sickle cell anemia where a valine replaces a glutamic acid in hemoglobin) can lead to profound structural changes and loss of function.\n\n3.  **Hierarchical Levels of Structure:** Protein structure is organized hierarchically:\n    *   **Primary:** Amino acid sequence.\n    *   **Secondary:** Localized folding patterns (alpha-helices, beta-sheets) stabilized by hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms. These provide structural motifs and stability.\n    *   **Tertiary:** The overall 3D shape of a single polypeptide chain, resulting from interactions between amino acid side chains (hydrophobic interactions, ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridges). This global fold creates specific functional domains.\n    *   **Quaternary:** The arrangement of multiple polypeptide subunits in multi-subunit proteins. The correct assembly and spatial orientation of these subunits are crucial for the function of protein complexes (e.g., the cooperative oxygen binding of hemoglobin requires its tetrameric structure).\n    Each level of structure is essential; disruption at any level can propagate and alter the final functional conformation.\n\n4.  **Dynamic Nature and Conformational Changes:** Protein structures are not rigid; they exhibit dynamic flexibility and undergo conformational changes. These changes are often essential for function (e.g., an enzyme undergoing an 'induced fit' upon substrate binding, or a molecular motor protein changing shape to produce movement). The ability to switch between specific functional conformations relies on the underlying structural integrity.\n\n5.  **Stability and Denaturation:** The precise 3D structure of a protein is maintained by a delicate balance of non-covalent interactions. Environmental factors like extreme temperature, pH, or harsh chemicals can disrupt these interactions, causing the protein to unfold or 'denature.' When denatured, the protein loses its specific 3D structure and, consequently, its biological activity. This direct correlation between structural integrity and functional capacity powerfully demonstrates that structure determines function.\n\nIn essence, a protein's function is intimately tied to its unique architecture, which is meticulously crafted from its amino acid sequence through a complex folding process. This precise structural arrangement enables the specific molecular interactions and dynamic changes required for all cellular activities.",
