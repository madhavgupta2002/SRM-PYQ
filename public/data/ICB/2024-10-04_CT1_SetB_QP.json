This process leads to the formation of distinct tissues and organs.\n\nIllustration (conceptual explanation): \n1.  **Early Development:** A zygote undergoes rapid cell division (cleavage) to form a multicellular embryo.\n2.  **Germ Layers:** Cells then organize into primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm), each committed to forming specific cell types, tissues, and organs.\n3.  **Tissue Formation:** Cells within these germ layers receive signals (chemical, physical) that activate or deactivate specific genes, directing them to differentiate into specialized cells (e.g., muscle cells, nerve cells, epithelial cells).\n4.  **Organogenesis:** Different specialized tissues then organize and interact to form functional organs (e.g., heart, brain, stomach), each with a unique structure and role. For example, neural precursor cells differentiate into neurons and glial cells, which then assemble to form the brain and spinal cord (organs). Muscle cells form muscle tissue, which then constitutes muscles (organs).",

Example: Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs).\n3.  **Multipotent Stem Cells:** Can differentiate into a limited range of cell types within a specific lineage or tissue. Example: Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) which form all blood cell types.\n4.  **Oligopotent Stem Cells:** Can differentiate into only a few cell types. Example: Lymphoid or myeloid stem cells.\n5.  **Unipotent Stem Cells:** Can only differentiate into one cell type, but have the capacity for self-renewal. Example: Skin stem cells, spermatogonial stem cells.\n\nSources of Stem Cells:\n1.  **Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs):** Derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst (an early-stage embryo, 4-5 days old). These are pluripotent.\n2.  **Adult Stem Cells (ASCs):** Found in various differentiated adult tissues (e.g., bone marrow, adipose tissue, brain, blood, skin).

They travel to target cells or organs throughout the body, where they bind to specific receptors and regulate a wide range of physiological processes, including growth, metabolism, reproduction, and mood.\n\nExplanation of various hormones:\n1.  **Insulin:** Produced by the pancreas. Its primary role is to lower blood glucose levels by promoting the uptake of glucose by cells for energy or storage as glycogen.\n2.  **Thyroxine (Thyroid Hormones - T3 and T4):** Produced by the thyroid gland. These hormones regulate metabolism, growth, and development. They influence heart rate, body temperature, and energy levels.\n3.  **Estrogen:** Primarily produced by the ovaries in females. It is crucial for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics, regulation of the menstrual cycle, and maintenance of pregnancy.\n4.  **Testosterone:** Primarily produced by the testes in males. It is responsible for the development of male secondary sexual characteristics, sperm production, and maintaining muscle mass and bone density.\n5.  **Cortisol:** Produced by the adrenal glands. Known as the 'stress hormone,' it plays a role in the body's response to stress, regulates metabolism, reduces inflammation, and helps control blood sugar levels.\n6.  **Growth Hormone (GH):** Produced by the pituitary gland. It stimulates growth, cell reproduction, and regeneration in humans and other animals.",

            "marks": 4,
            "answer": "Definition: Enzymes are biological catalysts, almost always proteins, that accelerate the rate of specific biochemical reactions without being consumed in the process.\n\nCharacteristics of Enzymes:\n1.  **Specificity:** Enzymes are highly specific, meaning each enzyme typically catalyzes only one or a very small number of reactions involving specific substrates. This is due to their unique three-dimensional active site that fits the substrate like a lock and key. For example, salivary amylase specifically breaks down starch but not proteins.\n2.  **Catalytic Efficiency:** Enzymes can increase reaction rates by millions or even billions of times compared to uncatalyzed reactions. They achieve this by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed. A single enzyme molecule can process thousands of substrate molecules per second.\n3.  **Optimal Conditions:** Enzymes function best under specific optimal conditions of temperature and pH. Deviations from these optimal conditions can lead to denaturation (loss of shape and function). For instance, most human enzymes have an optimal pH around 7.4 (body pH), while pepsin (in the stomach) works best at a very acidic pH (around 2).\n4.  **Unchanged After Reaction:** Enzymes are not consumed or permanently altered during the reaction. After catalyzing a reaction, they are released and can be reused to catalyze further reactions.\n5.  **Regulation:** Enzyme activity can be regulated by various factors, including activators, inhibitors, feedback mechanisms, and allosteric control, allowing cells to control metabolic pathways efficiently.\n\nExamples:\n*   **Amylase:** Breaks down starch into simpler sugars (e.g., in saliva).\n*   **Pepsin:** Digests proteins in the stomach.\n*   **DNA Polymerase:** Synthesizes new DNA strands during replication.\n*   **Lactase:** Breaks down lactose (milk sugar) into glucose and galactose.",

            "marks": 12,
            "answer": "Definition: Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two daughter cells each having the same number and kind of chromosomes as the parent nucleus, typical of ordinary tissue growth and asexual reproduction. It is a process of nuclear division, followed by cytokinesis (cytoplasmic division).\n\nPhases of Mitosis:\nMitosis is a continuous process, but it is typically divided into four distinct phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Interphase precedes mitosis, preparing the cell for division.\n\n1.  **Prophase:**\n    *   Chromosomes condense and become visible as distinct structures. Each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids joined at the centromere.\n    *   The nuclear envelope breaks down.\n    *   The nucleolus disappears.\n    *   The mitotic spindle (composed of microtubules) begins to form from the centrosomes, which move towards opposite poles of the cell.\n\n2.  **Metaphase:**\n    *   The condensed chromosomes align along the metaphase plate (an imaginary plane equidistant from the two poles of the spindle).\n    *   Each sister chromatid is attached to a spindle microtubule from opposite poles via its kinetochore (a protein structure at the centromere).\n    *   This alignment ensures that each new daughter cell will receive one copy of each chromosome.\n\n3.  **Anaphase:**\n    *   Sister chromatids suddenly separate at the centromere, becoming individual chromosomes.\n    *   These newly separated chromosomes are pulled towards opposite poles of the cell by the shortening of kinetochore microtubules.\n    *   The cell elongates as non-kinetochore microtubules lengthen.\n\n4.  **Telophase:**\n    *   The chromosomes arrive at the poles and begin to decondense (uncoil).\n    *   New nuclear envelopes form around the two sets of chromosomes at each pole.\n    *   The mitotic spindle disappears.\n    *   Nucleoli reappear within the new nuclei.\n    *   Mitosis (nuclear division) is complete, often followed immediately by cytokinesis.\n\n**Cytokinesis:**\n*   This is the division of the cytoplasm, usually beginning during late anaphase or telophase.\n*   In animal cells, a contractile ring of actin and myosin filaments forms a cleavage furrow that pinches the cell into two.\n*   In plant cells, a cell plate forms in the middle of the cell, eventually developing into a new cell wall separating the two daughter cells.\n\n**(Diagrammatic representation would include drawings of a cell depicting the nucleus, chromosomes, spindle fibers, and cell membrane/wall at each stage.)**",

            "answer": "Definition: Carbohydrates are organic molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, typically with a hydrogen-to-oxygen atom ratio of 2:1 (as in water). They are essential biomolecules that serve as the body's primary source of energy, structural components, and cellular recognition markers.\n\nTypes of Carbohydrates:\nCarbohydrates are broadly classified into three main groups based on their size and structural complexity:\n\n1.  **Monosaccharides (Simple Sugars):**\n    *   **Description:** The simplest form of carbohydrates. They are single sugar units that cannot be hydrolyzed into smaller carbohydrate units. They are typically sweet and water-soluble.\n    *   **Examples:**\n        *   **Glucose:** A hexose sugar, the primary energy source for living cells. Found in fruits, honey, and a breakdown product of larger carbohydrates.\n        *   **Fructose:** A hexose sugar, often called 'fruit sugar', found in fruits and honey. It is the sweetest naturally occurring sugar.\n        *   **Galactose:** A hexose sugar, primarily found as part of lactose (milk sugar).\n        *   **Ribose & Deoxyribose:** Pentose sugars (5 carbons) that are components of RNA and DNA, respectively.\n\n2.  **Disaccharides:**\n    *   **Description:** Formed when two monosaccharide units are joined together by a glycosidic bond through a dehydration reaction. They can be hydrolyzed back into their constituent monosaccharides.\n    *   **Examples:**\n        *   **Sucrose:** (Glucose + Fructose) - Common table sugar, found in sugarcane and sugar beets.\n        *   **Lactose:** (Glucose + Galactose) - 'Milk sugar', found in dairy products.\n        *   **Maltose:** (Glucose + Glucose) - 'Malt sugar', produced during the digestion of starch.\n\n3.  **Polysaccharides (Complex Carbohydrates):**\n    *   **Description:** Long chains of many (hundreds to thousands) monosaccharide units linked together by glycosidic bonds. They are typically not sweet, less soluble in water, and serve as storage or structural components.\n    *   **Examples:**\n        *   **Starch:** A major energy storage carbohydrate in plants. It is a polymer of glucose, found in grains, potatoes, and rice. It has two forms: amylose (unbranched) and amylopectin (branched).\n        *   **Glycogen:** The primary energy storage carbohydrate in animals (liver and muscles). It is a highly branched polymer of glucose, allowing for rapid glucose release.\n        *   **Cellulose:** A major structural component of plant cell walls. It is a linear polymer of glucose units linked by beta-glycosidic bonds, which are largely indigestible by humans.\n        *   **Chitin:** A structural polysaccharide found in the exoskeletons of insects and crustaceans, and in the cell walls of fungi. It is a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine.\n\n**(Diagrams would include: 1. A general representation of a monosaccharide (e.g., glucose in ring form). 2. A diagram showing two monosaccharides linked to form a disaccharide (e.g., sucrose). 3. A simplified representation of a polysaccharide chain (e.g., a segment of starch or cellulose).)**",
