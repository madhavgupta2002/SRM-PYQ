They also possess various membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. Eukaryotic cells are typically larger, have a more complex internal organization, and reproduce via mitosis and meiosis (e.g., animals, plants, fungi, protists).",

            "answer": "Mitosis is the primary process of cell division that aids in the growth and repair of multicellular organisms. It results in two genetically identical daughter cells from a single parent cell. The process involves several key phases:\n\n1.  **Interphase:** The cell grows, replicates its DNA, and prepares for division. It consists of G1 (growth), S (DNA synthesis), and G2 (further growth and organelle duplication) phases. The chromosomes are duplicated but remain as sister chromatids.\n2.  **Prophase:** Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes. The nuclear envelope begins to break down, and the mitotic spindle (microtubules) starts to form from centrosomes.\n3.  **Metaphase:** Chromosomes align at the metaphase plate (equator of the cell). Each sister chromatid is attached to a spindle fiber from opposite poles.\n4.  **Anaphase:** Sister chromatids separate and are pulled towards opposite poles of the cell by the shortening spindle fibers. Each separated chromatid is now considered a full chromosome.\n5.  **Telophase:** Chromosomes arrive at the poles and begin to decondense. New nuclear envelopes form around the two sets of chromosomes. The mitotic spindle disassembles.\n6.  **Cytokinesis:** The cytoplasm divides, forming two distinct daughter cells. In animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms; in plant cells, a cell plate forms.",

            "marks": 10,
            "answer": "Chemical bonds are forces that hold atoms together to form molecules and compounds. The main types include:\n\n1.  **Covalent Bonds:** Formed when atoms share electron pairs. They are strong and common in organic molecules.\n    *   *Example:* In a water molecule (H2O), oxygen shares electrons with two hydrogen atoms. In methane (CH4), carbon shares electrons with four hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Ionic Bonds:** Formed by the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, typically when one atom donates electrons to another. This usually occurs between a metal and a non-metal.\n    *   *Example:* Sodium chloride (NaCl). Sodium (Na) donates an electron to chlorine (Cl), forming Na+ and Cl- ions, which are attracted to each other.\n3.  **Hydrogen Bonds:** A weaker electrostatic attraction between a hydrogen atom (covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom like O, N, or F) and another electronegative atom in a different molecule or part of the same molecule. These are crucial in biology.\n    *   *Example:* Between water molecules, where the slightly positive hydrogen of one water molecule is attracted to the slightly negative oxygen of another. Also important in stabilizing DNA double helix and protein secondary structures.\n4.  **Van der Waals Forces:** Weak, short-range attractive forces between atoms or molecules, arising from temporary fluctuations in electron distribution, creating transient dipoles. They include London Dispersion Forces and dipole-dipole interactions.\n    *   *Example:* The attraction between nonpolar molecules like in fats or between base pairs in DNA (though hydrogen bonds are stronger). Geckos' ability to cling to surfaces is partly due to these forces.\n5.  **Peptide Bonds:** A special type of covalent bond that links amino acids together in proteins. It forms between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another, with the elimination of a water molecule.\n    *   *Example:* The bond connecting Alanine and Glycine in a dipeptide. This bond is central to protein primary structure.",

            "answer": "The Human Genome Project (HGP) was an international, collaborative research program launched in 1990 and completed in 2003, with the primary goal of mapping, sequencing, and making publicly accessible the entire human genome. The human genome consists of approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA, organized into 23 pairs of chromosomes.\n\nKey objectives of the HGP included:\n\n*   **Identify all the approximately 20,000-25,000 genes** in human DNA.\n*   **Determine the sequences of the 3 billion chemical base pairs** that make up human DNA.\n*   **Store this information in public databases.**\n*   **Develop faster, more efficient sequencing technologies.**\n*   **Develop tools for data analysis.**\n*   **Address the ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI)** that arose from the project.\n\nThe project utilized techniques like DNA sequencing (e.g., Sanger sequencing initially), bioinformatics tools for assembly and annotation, and eventually next-generation sequencing. Its completion provided a fundamental reference sequence for human biology, revolutionizing medicine, biotechnology, and the study of human evolution. It enabled the identification of genes associated with various diseases, leading to advances in diagnostics, pharmacogenomics, and gene therapy. The HGP laid the foundation for modern genomics and personalized medicine.",

            "marks": 10,
            "answer": "Computational protein structure prediction aims to determine the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. This is a crucial area in structural biology and bioinformatics, as knowing the structure is key to understanding function. Key methods include:\n\n1.  **Homology Modeling (Comparative Modeling):** This method is used when a protein's sequence is similar to a protein with an experimentally determined 3D structure (template). The known structure is used as a template to build a model of the target protein. Steps involve template identification, sequence alignment, model building, and model refinement/validation.\n2.  **Protein Threading (Fold Recognition):** Applied when there's no clear homologous template, but the target protein is predicted to adopt a known protein fold. The target sequence is \"threaded\" through a library of known protein folds to find the best fit, evaluating how well the sequence fits into the structural environment of each fold.\n3.  **De Novo (Ab Initio) Prediction:** Used when no homologous or fold templates are available. These methods attempt to predict the protein structure solely from its amino acid sequence and physiochemical principles, such as energy minimization. They are computationally intensive and challenging, often involving fragment assembly and Monte Carlo simulations (e.g., Rosetta, AlphaFold).\n4.  **Machine Learning/Deep Learning Approaches:** Recent advancements, particularly deep learning (e.g., AlphaFold2), have revolutionized prediction accuracy. These methods learn complex relationships between sequence and structure from vast datasets of known proteins, predicting inter-residue distances and orientations, which are then used to build the 3D structure.\n\nThese methods often rely on various algorithms, force fields (for energy calculations), and extensive computing power, leveraging databases of known protein sequences and structures (e.g., PDB, UniProt).",

            "marks": 10,
            "answer": "Computational methods, collectively known as immunoinformatics, play a vital role in understanding, predicting, and manipulating immune responses. They aid in various aspects of immunology:\n\n1.  **Epitope Prediction:** Identifying specific regions (epitopes) on antigens that are recognized by antibodies or T-cell receptors. Computational tools predict B-cell (linear and conformational) and T-cell (MHC class I and II binding) epitopes, crucial for vaccine design and diagnostic development.\n2.  **Vaccine Design:** Immunoinformatics accelerates vaccine development by predicting potential immunogens, optimizing vaccine constructs, and evaluating their efficacy *in silico*. This includes reverse vaccinology approaches.\n3.  **MHC Binding Prediction:** Algorithms predict which peptides will bind to specific Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules, a key step in T-cell activation. This is essential for understanding immune response specificity and for personalized medicine.\n4.  **Antibody Engineering and Design:** Computational tools are used to design and optimize antibodies for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes, including affinity maturation, humanization, and stability prediction.\n5.  **Immune System Modeling:** Simulating complex immune interactions (e.g., T-cell activation, immune cell migration, pathogen-host dynamics) to gain insights into disease progression, treatment responses, and vaccine effectiveness.\n6.  **Analysis of Immune Repertoire:** High-throughput sequencing generates vast amounts of data on T-cell and B-cell receptor repertoires. Computational tools are essential for analyzing this data to understand immune diversity, antigen specificity, and clonal expansion in various conditions.\n7.  **Immunodiagnostics:** Developing computational algorithms for interpreting diagnostic data, identifying biomarkers, and improving the accuracy of immune-based diagnostic tests.\n8.  **Drug Discovery:** Identifying immune-modulating compounds, predicting their targets, and optimizing their properties for treating autoimmune diseases, allergies, and cancer.\n\nThese applications rely on machine learning, statistical models, molecular dynamics simulations, and access to large immunological databases.",

            "marks": 15,
            "answer": "Cell organelles are specialized structures within a cell that perform specific functions, contributing to the cell's overall structure, survival, and activity. While diagrams cannot be generated in text, a detailed explanation of key organelles and their roles is provided:\n\n1.  **Nucleus:** (Diagram: Large, spherical, centrally located, with nuclear envelope (double membrane, pores), nucleolus, and chromatin). The nucleus houses the cell's genetic material (DNA) organized into chromosomes. It controls cell growth, metabolism, and reproduction by regulating gene expression and protein synthesis. The nucleolus within produces ribosomes.\n2.  **Mitochondria:** (Diagram: Oval-shaped, double-membraned organelle; inner membrane folded into cristae; matrix inside). Known as the 'powerhouse of the cell,' mitochondria are responsible for cellular respiration, generating most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used as a source of chemical energy.\n3.  **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):** (Diagram: Network of interconnected membranes forming sacs (cisternae) and tubules throughout the cytoplasm).\n    *   **Rough ER (RER):** Studded with ribosomes; involved in the synthesis, folding, modification, and transport of proteins destined for secretion or insertion into membranes.\n    *   **Smooth ER (SER):** Lacks ribosomes; involved in lipid synthesis, detoxification of drugs and poisons, and storage of calcium ions.\n4.  **Golgi Apparatus (Golgi Complex):** (Diagram: Stack of flattened membrane-bound sacs called cisternae, typically near the ER). Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids synthesized in the ER into vesicles for secretion or delivery to other organelles.\n5.  **Ribosomes:** (Diagram: Small particles, free in cytoplasm or attached to RER, composed of two subunits). The sites of protein synthesis (translation), where amino acids are assembled into polypeptides according to mRNA instructions.\n6.  **Lysosomes:** (Diagram: Small, spherical, membrane-bound sacs containing digestive enzymes). Break down waste materials, cellular debris, and foreign invaders (like bacteria), acting as the cell's recycling and waste disposal system.\n7.  **Peroxisomes:** (Diagram: Small, spherical, membrane-bound organelles containing enzymes for various metabolic reactions, often producing hydrogen peroxide). Involved in metabolic processes such as fatty acid breakdown and detoxification of harmful substances.\n8.  **Cytoskeleton:** (Diagram: Network of protein filaments and tubules, including microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments). Provides structural support, maintains cell shape, facilitates cell movement, and plays roles in intracellular transport and cell division.\n9.  **Plasma Membrane:** (Diagram: Fluid mosaic model showing lipid bilayer with embedded proteins, cholesterol, and carbohydrates). The outer boundary of animal cells, regulating the passage of substances into and out of the cell, involved in cell signaling and adhesion.\n\nTogether, these organelles create a compartmentalized environment, allowing specialized metabolic reactions to occur efficiently, maintaining the cell's internal environment (homeostasis), and enabling the cell to perform its diverse functions.",

            "answer": "### Structure of DNA\n(Diagram: A double helix structure showing two polynucleotide strands coiled around a central axis. Each strand composed of a sugar-phosphate backbone with nitrogenous bases projecting inwards. Bases are paired: Adenine with Thymine (2 H-bonds), Guanine with Cytosine (3 H-bonds). Strands are antiparallel, 5' to 3' and 3' to 5'.)\n\nDNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is the primary carrier of genetic information in most living organisms. Its structure, elucidated by Watson and Crick, is a double helix:\n\n1.  **Double Helix:** DNA consists of two long polynucleotide strands coiled around a central axis, forming a right-handed double helix. This structure provides stability and protects the genetic information.\n2.  **Sugar-Phosphate Backbone:** Each strand is made of a repeating sugar-phosphate backbone. The 'sugar' is deoxyribose (a five-carbon sugar), and it is linked to a phosphate group. These form phosphodiester bonds, creating the strong covalent backbone of each strand.\n3.  **Nitrogenous Bases:** Projecting inwards from the sugar-phosphate backbone are four types of nitrogenous bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T).\n4.  **Base Pairing:** The two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs:\n    *   Adenine (A) always pairs with Thymine (T) via two hydrogen bonds.\n    *   Guanine (G) always pairs with Cytosine (C) via three hydrogen bonds.\n    This specific pairing (Chargaff's rules) ensures that the two strands are complementary, allowing for accurate replication and repair.\n5.  **Antiparallel Strands:** The two strands run in opposite directions. One strand has a 5' (phosphate end) to 3' (hydroxyl end) orientation, while the complementary strand runs from 3' to 5'. This antiparallel arrangement is crucial for DNA replication and transcription.\n\n### Short Note on Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. AI aims to enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making, natural language understanding, visual perception, and pattern recognition.\n\nKey areas of AI include machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. In computational biology, AI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, is extensively used for tasks like protein structure prediction (e.g., AlphaFold), drug discovery, genomics data analysis, disease diagnosis, and modeling complex biological systems (e.g., neural networks mimicking biological systems). It allows for the identification of intricate patterns and predictions from large, complex biological datasets that would be intractable for traditional methods, thereby accelerating scientific discovery and applications in biotechnology and medicine.",
