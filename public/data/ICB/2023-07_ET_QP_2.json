This potency varies:\n    *   **Totipotent:** Can differentiate into all cell types, including embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues (e.g., zygote).\n    *   **Pluripotent:** Can differentiate into all cell types of the three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm), but not extra-embryonic tissues (e.g., embryonic stem cells).\n    *   **Multipotent:** Can differentiate into a limited number of cell types within a specific lineage (e.g., hematopoietic stem cells).\n    *   **Oligopotent:** Can differentiate into a few cell types.\n    *   **Unipotent:** Can differentiate into only one cell type (e.g., spermatogonial stem cells).\n\nApplications of Stem Cells:\n1.  **Regenerative Medicine/Cell Therapy:** Stem cells can replace damaged or diseased cells and tissues. Examples include: treating spinal cord injuries, Parkinson's disease, heart disease, type 1 diabetes, and burn victims.\n2.  **Drug Discovery and Testing:** Stem cells can be differentiated into specific cell types (e.g., cardiomyocytes, neurons) to create in vitro models for studying diseases and testing the efficacy and toxicity of new drugs, reducing reliance on animal testing.\n3.  **Disease Modeling:** Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be generated and differentiated into relevant cell types to study disease mechanisms in a dish, providing insights into genetic and complex disorders.\n4.  **Developmental Biology Research:** Studying stem cell differentiation provides fundamental insights into how organisms develop and how cells acquire specialized functions.",

            "marks": 10,
            "answer": "BLAST stands for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool. It is a widely used bioinformatics algorithm and program for comparing primary biological sequence information, such as amino acid sequences of proteins or nucleotides of DNA/RNA sequences. A BLAST search enables a user to compare a query sequence with a library or database of sequences and identify sequence similarities that indicate functional or evolutionary relationships.\n\n**How BLAST Works (Simplified):**\n1.  **Query Input:** The user submits a nucleotide or protein sequence (query).\n2.  **Seed Search:** BLAST breaks the query into short 'words' (k-mers). It then efficiently searches a database for exact matches to these words.\n3.  **Extension:** Once a match (seed) is found, BLAST extends the alignment in both directions to find larger, high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs).\n4.  **Statistical Evaluation:** The alignments are scored based on substitution matrices (e.g., BLOSUM for proteins, PAM for nucleotides) and gap penalties. Statistical significance (E-value) is calculated to determine if a match is likely due to chance.\n\n**Types of BLAST:**\n*   **blastn:** Nucleotide query against a nucleotide database.\n*   **blastp:** Protein query against a protein database.\n*   **blastx:** Translated nucleotide query (six frames) against a protein database (useful for unknown DNA sequences).\n*   **tblastn:** Protein query against a translated nucleotide database (six frames).\n*   **tblastx:** Translated nucleotide query against a translated nucleotide database (most computationally intensive).\n\n**Uses of BLAST:**\n1.  **Identify Unknown Sequences:** Determine the identity of a newly sequenced gene or protein by finding similar known sequences.\n2.  **Infer Function:** If a query sequence has high similarity to a sequence with known function, it can be inferred that the query sequence might have a similar function.\n3.  **Discover Homologs:** Identify homologous genes or proteins (sequences descended from a common ancestor) across different species.\n4.  **Study Evolutionary Relationships:** By comparing sequences from various organisms, insights into phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary conservation can be gained.\n5.  **Find Domains and Motifs:** Identify conserved protein domains or functional motifs within a query sequence.\n6.  **Gene Mapping and Assembly:** Used in genomic projects for aligning sequences, identifying overlapping regions, and aiding in genome assembly.",

            "marks": 10,
            "answer": "Transcription is the process by which genetic information from a DNA template is copied into an RNA molecule. In essence, it is the first step of gene expression, where a specific segment of DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), or transfer RNA (tRNA).\n\n**Steps of Transcription (in Eukaryotes):**\n1.  **Initiation:** RNA polymerase binds to a specific DNA sequence called the promoter, usually with the help of transcription factors. This binding unwinds a small section of the DNA double helix.\n2.  **Elongation:** RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template strand (3' to 5' direction), synthesizing a complementary RNA molecule (5' to 3' direction). It uses ribonucleoside triphosphates (ATP, UTP, CTP, GTP) as building blocks, forming phosphodiester bonds. Uracil (U) is incorporated in RNA instead of thymine (T).\n3.  **Termination:** Transcription stops when RNA polymerase encounters specific termination signals in the DNA sequence. The RNA polymerase then detaches from the DNA, and the newly synthesized RNA molecule is released.\n\n**Processing of the RNA End Product (Primary Transcript / Pre-mRNA in Eukaryotes):**\nIn eukaryotes, the primary RNA transcript (pre-mRNA) undergoes several modifications before it can be translated into protein. These processing steps occur in the nucleus and are crucial for the stability, transport, and proper translation of mRNA:\n\n1.  **5' Capping:** A modified guanine nucleotide (7-methylguanosine) is added to the 5' end of the pre-mRNA in a unique 5'-5' triphosphate linkage. This cap protects the mRNA from degradation by exonucleases, aids in its transport out of the nucleus, and is essential for ribosome binding and initiation of translation.\n\n2.  **3' Polyadenylation:** The 3' end of the pre-mRNA is cleaved at a specific recognition sequence, and then a tail of multiple adenine nucleotides (poly-A tail, typically 50-250 nucleotides long) is added by an enzyme called poly-A polymerase. The poly-A tail contributes to mRNA stability, protects against degradation, and plays a role in nuclear export and translation efficiency.\n\n3.  **RNA Splicing:** Most eukaryotic genes contain non-coding sequences called introns, interspersed within coding sequences called exons. RNA splicing is the process by which introns are removed from the pre-mRNA, and the remaining exons are precisely joined together. This complex process is carried out by a large molecular machine called the spliceosome, composed of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and other proteins. Alternative splicing can occur, where different combinations of exons are joined, allowing a single gene to produce multiple protein isoforms.",

            "marks": 10,
            "answer": "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in the human brain. They are designed to recognize patterns, make predictions, and learn from data, much like how the brain processes information. The fundamental basis of ANNs lies in their ability to model complex, non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs through interconnected processing units, or 'neurons'.\n\n**Basis of Artificial Neural Networks:**\nThe core idea behind ANNs is to simulate the way biological neurons process and transmit information. Key principles include:\n1.  **Interconnected Nodes (Neurons):** ANNs consist of many simple, highly interconnected processing units, analogous to biological neurons.\n2.  **Weighted Connections (Synapses):** Each connection between neurons has an associated weight, representing the strength or importance of that connection, similar to synaptic strengths in the brain.\n3.  **Activation Function:** Each neuron receives inputs from other neurons, processes them, and then produces an output. This processing involves summing the weighted inputs and passing them through an activation function (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU) which introduces non-linearity and determines the neuron's output.\n4.  **Learning:** ANNs learn by adjusting the weights of their connections based on training data. This adjustment process, often achieved through algorithms like backpropagation, aims to minimize the difference between the network's predicted output and the actual desired output.\n5.  **Parallel Processing:** Information processing occurs in parallel across many neurons, allowing for fast and robust computations.\n\n**Parts of a Neural Network:**\nAn artificial neural network typically consists of several layers of interconnected nodes:\n1.  **Input Layer:**\n    *   **Description:** This is the first layer of the network. Each node in the input layer represents an input feature (e.g., a pixel value in an image, a gene expression level). \n    *   **Function:** It receives the raw data from the outside world and passes it on to the next layer. Input nodes do not perform any computations other than distributing the input values.\n\n2.  **Hidden Layers:**\n    *   **Description:** These layers are located between the input and output layers. A network can have one or many hidden layers (deep learning networks have many).\n    *   **Function:** Hidden layers perform computations on the inputs received from the previous layer. Each node (neuron) in a hidden layer applies weights to its inputs, sums them, and then passes the result through an activation function to produce an output that is sent to the next layer. These layers are crucial for learning complex patterns and representations in the data.\n\n3.  **Output Layer:**\n    *   **Description:** This is the final layer of the network.\n    *   **Function:** The output layer produces the final result of the network's processing. The number of nodes in the output layer depends on the type of problem (e.g., one node for binary classification, multiple nodes for multi-class classification or regression). The activation function used here might also be tailored to the specific output format required (e.g., sigmoid for probabilities, softmax for class distributions).",

            "answer": "Humoral immunity (or antibody-mediated immunity) is a type of adaptive immunity that involves the production of antibodies by B lymphocytes (B cells) in response to specific antigens. These antibodies circulate in the blood and lymph, neutralizing extracellular pathogens and toxins. \n\n**Diagram Description for Humoral Immunity:**\n\n**(Figure 1: Activation of B cells and Antibody Production)**\n\n*   **Antigen Presentation & B cell Activation:**\n    *   An antigen (e.g., a bacterial toxin) is encountered. \n    *   B cells, with their B cell receptors (BCRs) on their surface, bind directly to the specific antigen. The B cell acts as an Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) by internalizing the antigen, processing it, and presenting fragments on its surface via MHC class II molecules. \n    *   A helper T cell (Th cell) that has been previously activated by the same antigen (presented by another APC like a macrophage or dendritic cell) recognizes the antigen-MHC II complex on the B cell surface. \n    *   The Th cell then delivers co-stimulatory signals (e.g., CD40-CD40L interaction) and secretes cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-5) to fully activate the B cell.\n\n*   **Clonal Expansion & Differentiation:**\n    *   The activated B cell undergoes rapid proliferation (clonal expansion), producing many identical B cells.\n    *   These B cells differentiate into two main types:\n        *   **Plasma Cells:** Antibody-secreting factories. They are large cells with extensive endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, specialized for mass production and secretion of antibodies specific to the antigen.\n        *   **Memory B Cells:** Long-lived cells that persist in the body for years or decades. They are responsible for a faster, stronger, and more prolonged immune response upon subsequent exposure to the same antigen.\n\n*   **Antibody Functions (Effector Mechanisms):**\n    *   **Neutralization:** Antibodies bind to toxins or viruses, preventing them from interacting with host cells and causing damage.\n    *   **Opsonization:** Antibodies coat the surface of pathogens, making them more easily recognized and engulfed by phagocytes (e.g., macrophages, neutrophils).\n    *   **Complement Activation:** Antibodies (especially IgM and IgG) can activate the complement system, a cascade of proteins that leads to the lysis of pathogens or enhanced phagocytosis.\n    *   **Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC):** Antibodies bind to infected cells or tumor cells, flagging them for destruction by NK cells.\n\n**(Visual Elements for the Diagram):**\n*   **Top Left:** Antigen (e.g., a bacteria with surface antigens).\n*   **Left Center:** B cell with Y-shaped B cell receptors binding to the antigen.

            "marks": 15,
            "answer": "Similarity between protein sequences is a fundamental concept in computational biology, often indicating shared characteristics.\n\n**(i) How their function will be similar?**\nWhen two protein sequences are similar, it is highly likely that their functions will also be similar, or even identical. This is justified by the following principles:\n\n*   **Structure-Function Relationship:** A protein's function is intimately linked to its three-dimensional (3D) structure, which, in turn, is primarily determined by its amino acid sequence (primary structure). If two proteins have similar sequences, they are very likely to fold into similar 3D structures. Similar structures imply similar binding sites, catalytic sites, and overall molecular architecture, leading to similar functions.\n*   **Conservation of Functional Residues:** Functional regions of a protein (e.g., active sites, binding domains, phosphorylation sites) are often under strong evolutionary pressure to maintain their sequence and structure. Mutations in these critical regions are usually detrimental, so they tend to be conserved across similar proteins. Therefore, sequence similarity, especially in these functional motifs, strongly predicts functional similarity.\n*   **Domain Conservation:** Many proteins are modular, composed of distinct protein domains, each associated with a particular function. If two proteins share similar sequences, they often share common domains. Sharing domains implies sharing the functions associated with those domains, even if the overall proteins have slight differences.\n*   **Evolutionary Pressure:** Proteins with essential functions are highly conserved. If a particular sequence performs a vital role, organisms that maintain that sequence (or a highly similar one) throughout evolution will likely retain that function.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while high sequence similarity strongly *predicts* functional similarity, 100% identity is not always required for identical function, and sometimes even low sequence similarity can indicate distant functional relationships if critical motifs are conserved. Also, convergent evolution can sometimes lead to similar functions from dissimilar sequences, though this is less common for high sequence similarity.\n\n**(ii) The organisms that contain these proteins are evolutionarily related.**\nHigh similarity between two protein sequences in different organisms is a strong indicator that those organisms are evolutionarily related. This justification is based on the concept of homology and common descent:\n\n*   **Homology:** Sequence similarity (beyond what would be expected by chance) suggests that the two proteins are homologous, meaning they descended from a common ancestral protein. Homology implies a shared evolutionary origin.\n*   **Gene Duplication and Divergence:** Over evolutionary time, genes can be duplicated. The duplicated copies can then diverge through mutations. If the two organisms share a common ancestor, they might both inherit copies of a gene from that ancestor. Subsequent evolution in each lineage might lead to minor changes in the protein sequence, but the fundamental similarity (homology) persists.\n*   **Molecular Clock Hypothesis:** The rate at which mutations accumulate in a protein sequence can be relatively constant over long evolutionary periods (though this is a simplification). Therefore, the degree of sequence similarity (or dissimilarity) can be used to estimate the evolutionary distance between organisms. More similar sequences suggest a more recent common ancestor, implying closer evolutionary relatedness.\n*   **Conservation Across Species:** Essential proteins (e.g., ribosomal proteins, histones, enzymes in central metabolic pathways) are often highly conserved across vast evolutionary distances, from bacteria to humans. Finding highly similar versions of such proteins in two different species provides strong evidence that those species share a common ancestor, even if that ancestor lived millions or billions of years ago.\n*   **Phylogenetic Analysis:** Computational tools use sequence alignments and similarities to build phylogenetic trees, which graphically represent the evolutionary relationships among different species or genes. These trees are constructed based on the premise that greater sequence similarity implies closer evolutionary kinship.",
