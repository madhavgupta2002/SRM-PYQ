            "marks": 1,
            "answer": "D. All cells contain the same organelles. The main tenets of cell theory are that all living things are composed of cells, cells are the basic unit of life, and all cells arise from pre-existing cells. Different cell types contain different sets and quantities of organelles depending on their specialized functions.",

Glucagon would be released to cause blood glucose to fall.\nC. Insulin would be released to cause blood glucose to rise.\nD. Insulin and glucagon would be released to cause blood glucose to rise.",
            "marks": 1,
            "answer": "When blood glucose concentration decreases, the body's homeostatic response is to release glucagon. Glucagon stimulates the liver to release stored glucose, thereby *raising* blood glucose levels. Among the given options, only the release of glucagon is correctly identified as a response to falling glucose, though its described effect 'to cause blood glucose to fall' in option B is incorrect. The purpose of glucagon release is to *increase* blood glucose.",

            "marks": 1,
            "answer": "A. Shivering. Shivering, vasoconstriction of blood vessels in the dermis, and an increase in metabolic rate are all physiological responses that generate or conserve heat to counteract hypothermia, thereby acting as negative feedback mechanisms. Sweating, however, is a response to hyperthermia (overheating) and causes heat loss, thus it would not be a response to hypothermia.",

The body ignores changes in a physiological variable that are directed away from the set point for that\nvariable.\nC. The body's response acts to oppose the change in the physiological variable.\nD. The body's response acts to enhance the change in the physiological variable",
            "marks": 1,
            "answer": "D. The body's response acts to enhance the change in the physiological variable. Positive feedback loops amplify or intensify the initial change, moving the physiological variable further away from the set point, often leading to a rapid completion of a process (e.g., childbirth, blood clotting).",
