Examples include glucose (primary energy source), fructose (fruit sugar), and galactose (milk sugar).\n2.  **Disaccharides:** Formed by the glycosidic linkage of two monosaccharide units. Examples include sucrose (glucose + fructose, table sugar), lactose (glucose + galactose, milk sugar), and maltose (glucose + glucose).\n3.  **Polysaccharides:** Complex carbohydrates formed by many monosaccharide units linked together. Examples include starch (energy storage in plants), glycogen (energy storage in animals), cellulose (structural component in plant cell walls), and chitin (structural component in fungi cell walls and insect exoskeletons).\n\n**Importance in Life Processes:**\n1.  **Energy Source:** Glucose is the primary fuel for cellular respiration, providing ATP for metabolic activities. Starch and glycogen serve as energy reserves.\n2.  **Structural Components:** Cellulose provides structural support to plant cell walls. Chitin forms the exoskeleton of arthropods and cell walls of fungi. Glycosaminoglycans are components of connective tissues.\n3.  **Cell Recognition and Signaling:** Oligosaccharides attached to proteins (glycoproteins) and lipids (glycolipids) on cell surfaces are crucial for cell-cell recognition, adhesion, and signaling processes, playing roles in immune response, development, and tissue formation.\n4.  **Genetic Material Precursors:** Ribose and deoxyribose are pentose sugars that are fundamental components of RNA and DNA, respectively.",

            "marks": 10,
            "answer": "Translation is the process by which messenger RNA (mRNA) is decoded by a ribosome to produce a specific amino acid sequence, known as a polypeptide chain or protein. It occurs in three main stages:\n\n1.  **Initiation:**\n    *   The small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA, typically at the 5' cap and then scans for the start codon (AUG) in eukaryotes, or directly binds to a Shine-Dalgarno sequence in prokaryotes.\n    *   The initiator tRNA (carrying methionine in eukaryotes, formylmethionine in prokaryotes) binds to the AUG start codon.\n    *   The large ribosomal subunit then joins the complex, forming a complete ribosome with the initiator tRNA in the P (peptidyl) site.\n\n2.  **Elongation:**\n    *   **Codon Recognition:** A new aminoacyl-tRNA, carrying the amino acid corresponding to the codon in the A (aminoacyl) site, binds to the A site.\n    *   **Peptide Bond Formation:** A peptide bond is formed between the amino acid in the A site and the growing polypeptide chain in the P site, catalyzed by the peptidyl transferase activity of the large ribosomal subunit (rRNA).\n    *   **Translocation:** The ribosome moves along the mRNA by one codon (3 nucleotides) in the 5' to 3' direction. The tRNA in the P site (now uncharged) moves to the E (exit) site, and the tRNA with the growing polypeptide chain moves from the A site to the P site. The E site tRNA is then released.\n    *   This cycle repeats for each successive codon on the mRNA.\n\n3.  **Termination:**\n    *   Elongation continues until a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) enters the A site.\n    *   No tRNA recognizes stop codons. Instead, release factors proteins bind to the stop codon in the A site.\n    *   The release factors catalyze the hydrolysis of the bond between the polypeptide and the tRNA in the P site, leading to the release of the completed polypeptide chain.\n    *   The ribosomal subunits dissociate from the mRNA, ready for a new round of translation.",

            "answer": "Proteins are complex macromolecules composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. They are vital for virtually all cellular functions.\n\n**Classification of Proteins:**\nProteins can be classified based on their shape, composition, or function.\n\n**Based on Shape:**\n1.  **Fibrous Proteins:** Elongated, insoluble in water, and provide structural support. Examples: collagen (connective tissue), keratin (hair, nails), myosin (muscle contraction).\n2.  **Globular Proteins:** Compact, spherical, generally water-soluble, and often have catalytic or regulatory functions. Examples: enzymes (e.g., hemoglobin), antibodies, hormones.\n\n**Based on Composition:**\n1.  **Simple Proteins:** Composed solely of amino acid residues. Examples: albumin, globulins.\n2.  **Conjugated Proteins:** Composed of amino acid residues and a non-protein part called a prosthetic group. Examples: Glycoproteins (with carbohydrates), Lipoproteins (with lipids), Metalloproteins (with metal ions), Nucleoproteins (with nucleic acids), Chromoproteins (with pigments).\n\n**Structure of Proteins (Levels of Organization):**\n1.  **Primary Structure:** The linear sequence of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. This sequence is determined by the genetic code and dictates all higher-order structures.\n2.  **Secondary Structure:** Local folded structures that form within a polypeptide chain due to hydrogen bonds between atoms of the polypeptide backbone. The most common secondary structures are:\n    *   **Alpha-helix (\u03b1-helix):** A right-handed coiled structure where the carbonyl oxygen of one amino acid forms a hydrogen bond with the amino group hydrogen of an amino acid four residues ahead.\n    *   **Beta-pleated sheet (\u03b2-sheet):** Formed by hydrogen bonds between adjacent polypeptide strands, which can be parallel or antiparallel, creating a pleated, sheet-like conformation.\n3.  **Tertiary Structure:** The overall three-dimensional shape of a single polypeptide chain, resulting from interactions between the side chains (R-groups) of the amino acids. These interactions include hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, disulfide bridges, and hydrophobic interactions.\n4.  **Quaternary Structure:** The arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) in a multi-subunit protein complex. Not all proteins have quaternary structure. Interactions between subunits are similar to those in tertiary structure.",

            "marks": 10,
            "answer": "An **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in the brain. It consists of interconnected nodes (artificial neurons or perceptrons) organized in layers, designed to learn and process information.\n\n**Working Principle:**\nAn ANN typically has an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each neuron in a layer connects to neurons in the subsequent layer with associated 'weights'.\n1.  **Inputs:** Neurons in the input layer receive data (features).\n2.  **Weighted Sum:** Each connection has a weight (W), representing the strength of the connection. For a given neuron, the inputs are multiplied by their respective weights and summed up (\u03a3Wi * Xi).\n3.  **Bias:** A bias term (b) is added to the weighted sum, which allows the activation function to be shifted.\n4.  **Activation Function:** The weighted sum plus bias is then passed through a non-linear activation function (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU, tanh). This function determines the neuron's output or 'activation'.\n5.  **Output:** The output of one layer serves as input to the next layer. The final output layer produces the network's prediction.\n6.  **Learning (Training):** During training, the network is fed with labeled data. The actual output is compared with the desired output, and an error is calculated. This error is then propagated backward through the network (backpropagation algorithm) to adjust the weights and biases, minimizing the error over time. This iterative process allows the ANN to learn patterns and make accurate predictions.\n\n**Applications in Biology:**\n1.  **Sequence Analysis:** Predicting protein structure from amino acid sequences, identifying gene regulatory regions, and classifying DNA/RNA sequences.\n2.  **Drug Discovery:** Virtual screening of drug candidates, predicting drug-target interactions, and optimizing drug design.\n3.  **Medical Diagnosis:** Image analysis for disease detection (e.g., tumor detection in radiology), predicting disease susceptibility, and personalized medicine.\n4.  **Bioinformatics:** Pattern recognition in large biological datasets, protein function prediction, and pathway analysis.\n5.  **Neuroscience:** Modeling neural activity, understanding brain function, and developing brain-computer interfaces.",

            "answer": "Epitope prediction is a crucial field within immunoinformatics, aiming to identify specific regions of antigens that are recognized by T cells (T-cell epitopes) or B cells (B-cell epitopes). This is vital for vaccine development, diagnostic design, and understanding immune responses.\n\n**T-Cell Epitope Prediction:**\nT-cell epitopes are typically short (8-20 amino acids), linear peptides derived from processed antigens that are presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to T-cell receptors. Prediction tools for T-cell epitopes often focus on MHC-peptide binding.\n\n**Methods and Tools:**\n1.  **MHC Binding Prediction:** These are the most common tools. They use various algorithms (e.g., Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Hidden Markov Models, Quantitative Matrix models) trained on experimental data of known MHC-peptide binders.\n    *   **NetMHCpan:** A highly popular and accurate pan-specific method that can predict peptide binding to any MHC class I or class II molecule, even those not directly represented in the training data, by incorporating MHC allele sequence information.\n    *   **SYFPEITHI:** An early, widely used database and prediction system based on motif identification from known MHC ligands.\n    *   **IEDB (Immune Epitope Database) Analysis Resource:** A comprehensive online platform offering various prediction tools for MHC class I and II binding (e.g., Consensus, SMM, NetMHC/NetMHCpan, SMMPMBEC, PickPocket).\n2.  **MHC Processing Prediction:** Some advanced tools attempt to predict not only binding but also the entire antigen processing pathway, including proteasomal cleavage (for MHC class I) and transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) binding.\n    *   **NetChop:** Predicts proteasomal cleavage sites.\n    *   **TAPpred:** Predicts peptide binding to TAP transporters.\n3.  **T-cell Receptor (TCR) Interaction Prediction:** Emerging tools aim to predict the actual interaction between the peptide-MHC complex and the TCR, which is more complex due to TCR diversity and specificity.\n\n**B-Cell Epitope Prediction:**\nB-cell epitopes are regions of antigens that are recognized directly by B-cell receptors (antibodies). They can be linear (sequential amino acids) or conformational (amino acids brought together by protein folding). B-cell epitope prediction is generally more challenging than T-cell prediction due to the complex, often conformational nature of these epitopes.\n\n**Methods and Tools:**\n1.  **Physicochemical Property-Based Methods:** These tools identify regions with characteristics typically found in B-cell epitopes, such as:\n    *   **Hydrophilicity/Solvent Accessibility:** Epitopes are often on the surface of proteins and accessible to antibodies. Tools like Kolaskar & Tongaonkar, Hopp & Woods use hydrophilicity scales.\n    *   **Flexibility/Antigenicity:** Flexible regions are often good epitopes. Tools like Karplus & Schulz, Bepipred use flexibility and antigenicity scales.\n    *   **Surface Protrusion:** Regions extending out from the protein surface are more likely to be accessible.\n2.  **Machine Learning Approaches:** Algorithms (e.g., SVM, ANNs) are trained on datasets of known B-cell epitopes to learn complex patterns.\n    *   **BepiPred (e.g., BepiPred-2.0):** Uses a random forest algorithm trained on experimentally validated linear B-cell epitopes to predict linear B-cell epitopes based on propensity scales.\n    *   **ABCpred:** An ANN-based method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes.\n3.  **Structure-Based Methods:** These are considered more accurate for conformational epitopes but require the 3D structure of the antigen.\n    *   **Geometric Algorithms:** Identify surface patches that are accessible and have characteristics like curvature or protrusion, then score them based on physicochemical properties.\n    *   **Machine learning on structural features:** Incorporates features like residue depth, contact number, and secondary structure to predict conformational epitopes.\n    *   **ElliPro:** An algorithm that approximates the protein's shape as an ellipsoid and calculates residue protrusion indices, then clusters residues based on their geometric proximity.\n4.  **Hybrid Methods:** Combine linear and conformational prediction methods, sometimes integrating evolutionary conservation or immune response data.\n\nBoth T-cell and B-cell epitope prediction are continuously evolving, with increasing accuracy and sophistication. They are indispensable for rational vaccine design, identifying immunogenic regions for diagnostic assays, and understanding immune system function.",

            "answer": "Eukaryotic cells are characterized by the presence of a membrane-bound nucleus and various other membrane-bound organelles, which compartmentalize cellular functions and increase efficiency. Here's a description of key eukaryotic organelles and their functions:\n\n1.  **Nucleus:**\n    *   **Description:** The largest organelle, usually spherical, enclosed by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope, which contains nuclear pores. It houses the cell's genetic material (DNA) organized into chromosomes.\n    *   **Function:** Controls cell growth, metabolism, and reproduction. Site of DNA replication and transcription (synthesis of RNA from DNA). Ribosome synthesis occurs in the nucleolus, a dense structure within the nucleus.\n\n2.  **Mitochondria:**\n    *   **Description:** Often called the \"powerhouses\" of the cell, these are double-membraned organelles. The inner membrane is highly folded into cristae, increasing surface area for reactions. They contain their own circular DNA and ribosomes.\n    *   **Function:** Primary site of cellular respiration, generating most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n3.  **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):**\n    *   **Description:** A vast network of interconnected membranes that extends throughout the cytoplasm, forming sacs (cisternae) and tubules.
