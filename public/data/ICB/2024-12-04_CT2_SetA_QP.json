This cap protects the mRNA from degradation and is essential for translation initiation.\n2.  **3' Polyadenylation**: The 3' end of the pre-mRNA is cleaved, and a tail of several hundred adenine nucleotides (poly-A tail) is added. This tail enhances stability, aids export from the nucleus, and is involved in translation.\n3.  **Splicing**: Introns are removed, and exons are ligated together. This process is catalyzed by a large ribonucleoprotein complex called the spliceosome. Splicing ensures that only the coding sequences are present in the mature mRNA, allowing it to be translated into a functional protein.",

These interactions include:\n    *   Hydrophobic interactions: Nonpolar R-groups cluster together away from water.\n    *   Ionic bonds: Attractions between oppositely charged R-groups.\n    *   Hydrogen bonds: Between polar R-groups.\n    *   Disulfide bonds: Covalent bonds between two cysteine residues.\n    *   *Drawing/Diagram*: A complex, folded 3D shape representing a single protein molecule, showing various interaction types.\n\n4.  **Quaternary Structure**: Applies to proteins composed of two or more polypeptide chains (subunits). It describes the arrangement and interaction of these multiple subunits to form a functional multi-subunit protein complex. Interactions are similar to tertiary structure.\n    *   *Drawing/Diagram*: Two or more distinct tertiary structures (subunits) associated together to form a larger complex (e.g., hemoglobin with four subunits).",

It does not require prior exposure to a pathogen and has no memory. Key components include:\n\n1.  **Physical Barriers**: Prevent pathogen entry.\n    *   **Skin**: Intact skin acts as a robust physical barrier, and its acidic pH and antimicrobial peptides (e.g., defensins) inhibit microbial growth.\n    *   **Mucous Membranes**: Line respiratory, digestive, urinary, and reproductive tracts.

      "question_text": "Describe Bcell and Tcell epitope prediction",
      "marks": 8,
      "answer": "Epitope prediction is a computational approach used in immunoinformatics to identify specific regions (epitopes) of an antigen that are recognized by antibodies (B-cell epitopes) or T-cell receptors (T-cell epitopes). This is crucial for vaccine design, diagnostics, and immunotherapy.\n\n**B-cell Epitope Prediction:**\nB-cell epitopes are typically found on the surface of proteins and are recognized by antibodies in their native 3D conformation. They can be linear (sequential amino acids) or conformational (amino acids brought together by protein folding).\n*   **Methods**: Primarily rely on physicochemical properties and structural features.\n    *   **Sequence-based methods**: Look for regions with high hydrophilicity, flexibility, accessibility, antigenicity, or turns/loops. Tools like Bepipred, ABCpred, and BepiPred-2.0 utilize machine learning or propensity scales.\n    *   **Structure-based methods**: Use known 3D protein structures to identify surface-exposed residues, often using algorithms that consider residue solvent accessibility and clustering of residues in 3D space. Tools like DiscoTope and Epitopia fall into this category. These methods are generally more accurate for conformational epitopes.\n\n**T-cell Epitope Prediction:**\nT-cell epitopes are typically short linear peptides derived from intracellular processing of antigens, which are then presented on the cell surface by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules for recognition by T-cell receptors. T-cell epitopes are MHC-restricted.\n*   **Methods**: Focus on identifying peptides that can bind effectively to specific MHC alleles.\n    *   **MHC Class I Epitope Prediction**: Targets CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). Predictions involve identifying peptides (typically 8-11 amino acids) that bind to MHC class I molecules. Methods often use motif-based approaches, position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), or support vector machines (SVMs) trained on known MHC binders. Tools like NetMHCpan and SYFPEITHI are commonly used.\n    *   **MHC Class II Epitope Prediction**: Targets CD4+ helper T-lymphocytes. Predictions involve identifying peptides (typically 13-25 amino acids) that bind to MHC class II molecules. These are more challenging due to the promiscuous binding nature of MHC class II molecules and the less defined binding groove. Similar computational approaches (PSSMs, ANNs, SVMs) are used, often considering conserved anchor residues. Tools include NetMHCIIpan and MHCII binding prediction tools.\n    *   **Proteasomal Cleavage Prediction**: For MHC Class I, predicting where the proteasome will cleave the protein is also crucial, as only specific fragments are presented. Tools like NetChop are used for this.\n\nBoth B-cell and T-cell epitope prediction benefit from the integration of experimental data, genomic/proteomic sequences, and advanced machine learning techniques to improve accuracy and specificity.",

      "question_text": "Explain with examples of autonomous and somatic nervous systems with elaborate examples",
      "marks": 15,
      "answer": "The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is divided into two major functional divisions: the Somatic Nervous System (SNS) and the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS).\n\n**1. Somatic Nervous System (SNS)**:\n*   **Function**: Responsible for voluntary control of skeletal muscles and relaying sensory information from the body's periphery (e.g., skin, muscles, joints) to the central nervous system (CNS).\n*   **Control**: Conscious and voluntary.\n*   **Effector Organs**: Skeletal muscles.\n*   **Neurotransmitters**: Primarily acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction.\n*   **Pathway**: A single motor neuron (efferent neuron) extends directly from the CNS to the skeletal muscle, releasing ACh.\n*   **Sensory Input**: Receives sensory input (touch, pain, temperature, proprioception) from sensory receptors in the skin, muscles, and joints.\n\n    **Examples**: \n    *   **Voluntary Movement**: When you decide to pick up a pen, the SNS sends signals from your brain (motor cortex) down the spinal cord and then via somatic motor neurons to the muscles in your arm and hand, causing them to contract precisely to grasp the pen. Similarly, standing up, walking, or writing are all SNS-controlled actions.\n    *   **Reflex Arcs (Somatic Reflexes)**: Although involuntary, somatic reflexes are mediated by the SNS. For instance, the **patellar reflex (knee-jerk reflex)** occurs when the patellar tendon is tapped, stretching the quadriceps muscle. Sensory neurons detect this stretch and directly synapse with motor neurons in the spinal cord, which then cause the quadriceps to contract, extending the leg. This rapid, protective response bypasses conscious thought.\n    *   **Sensory Perception**: Feeling the warmth of the sun on your skin, the pain of a cut finger, or the texture of sandpaper are all functions of the somatic sensory division, which relays this information to the brain for interpretation.\n\n**2. Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)**:\n*   **Function**: Responsible for involuntary control of internal organs, regulating unconscious bodily functions to maintain homeostasis. It manages vital functions like heart rate, digestion, respiration, salivation, perspiration, pupil dilation, and sexual arousal.\n*   **Control**: Involuntary and unconscious.\n*   **Effector Organs**: Smooth muscle (e.g., in intestines, blood vessels), cardiac muscle (heart), and glands.\n*   **Neurotransmitters**: Acetylcholine (ACh) and norepinephrine (NE).\n*   **Pathway**: Typically involves a two-neuron chain: a preganglionic neuron (from CNS to ganglion) and a postganglionic neuron (from ganglion to effector organ).\n*   **Divisions**: The ANS is further divided into two antagonistic systems:\n    *   **a) Sympathetic Nervous System (Fight or Flight)**: Prepares the body for stress or emergencies.\n        *   **Examples**:\n            *   **Stress Response**: In a dangerous situation, your sympathetic nervous system kicks in: your **heart rate increases** (to pump more blood), **pupils dilate** (to improve vision), **bronchioles in lungs dilate** (to take in more oxygen), **digestion slows down** (blood diverted to muscles), **sweating increases** (to cool the body), and **adrenaline (epinephrine) is released** from the adrenal medulla. These combined actions prepare the body for intense physical activity or escape.\n            *   **Blood Pressure Regulation**: When you stand up quickly, the sympathetic system constricts blood vessels to prevent a sudden drop in blood pressure and maintain blood flow to the brain.\n    *   **b) Parasympathetic Nervous System (Rest and Digest)**: Promotes calming, energy conservation, and routine maintenance functions.\n        *   **Examples**:\n            *   **Relaxation Response**: After a meal, the parasympathetic system dominates: **heart rate decreases**, **pupils constrict**, **bronchioles constrict**, **digestion is stimulated** (increased gastric secretions and gut motility), and energy stores are replenished. This promotes a state of rest and aids in nutrient absorption.\n            *   **Urination and Defecation**: The parasympathetic system plays a key role in relaxing sphincters and contracting smooth muscles in the bladder and rectum to facilitate elimination.",

      "question_text": "Hemoglobin protein is synthesized using an intracellular process. Explain in detail",
      "marks": 15,
      "answer": "Hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells, is a complex protein synthesized through a multi-step intracellular process primarily involving transcription and translation. This process occurs in erythroblasts (precursor red blood cells) in the bone marrow.\n\n**1. Transcription (Nucleus):**\n*   **Gene Activation**: The genes for the alpha (α) and beta (β) globin chains (hemoglobin is composed of two α and two β chains in adults, HbA) are located on different chromosomes (chromosome 16 for α-globin, chromosome 11 for β-globin).\n*   **RNA Polymerase II**: This enzyme binds to the promoter regions of the α-globin and β-globin genes.\n*   **mRNA Synthesis**: RNA polymerase II unwinds the DNA helix and synthesizes pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) molecules, using the DNA as a template. This pre-mRNA contains both exons (coding regions) and introns (non-coding regions).\n*   **RNA Processing**: The pre-mRNA undergoes several modifications:\n    *   **5' Capping**: A 7-methylguanosine cap is added to the 5' end.\n    *   **3' Polyadenylation**: A poly-A tail is added to the 3' end.\n    *   **Splicing**: Introns are removed by the spliceosome, and exons are ligated together to form mature mRNA. This mature mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.\n\n**2. Translation (Cytoplasm):**\n*   **Ribosome Binding**: The mature α-globin and β-globin mRNAs bind to ribosomes (specifically, free ribosomes in the cytoplasm of erythroblasts). Translation typically begins with the smaller ribosomal subunit binding to the 5' cap and scanning for the start codon (AUG).\n*   **tRNA Recruitment**: Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid, are recruited to the ribosome. The anticodon on the tRNA pairs with the codon on the mRNA.\n*   **Peptide Chain Elongation**: The ribosome moves along the mRNA, reading codons. Each time a new tRNA binds, its amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain via a peptide bond, formed by peptidyl transferase activity of the ribosome.\n*   **Termination**: When a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is encountered, a release factor binds, leading to the dissociation of the ribosome from the mRNA and the release of the newly synthesized globin polypeptide chain (either an α-globin chain or a β-globin chain).\n\n**3. Post-Translational Modification and Assembly:**\n*   **Folding**: Immediately after synthesis, the linear α-globin and β-globin polypeptide chains begin to fold into their specific three-dimensional tertiary structures, guided by chaperone proteins.\n*   **Heme Synthesis (Concurrently)**: While globin chains are being synthesized, heme groups are concurrently synthesized in the mitochondria and cytoplasm of erythroblasts. Heme is an iron-containing porphyrin ring that binds oxygen.\n*   **Globin-Heme Association**: Each folded α-globin and β-globin chain binds to one heme molecule. This creates two α-globin-heme monomers and two β-globin-heme monomers.\n*   **Quaternary Structure Formation**: Finally, two α-globin-heme monomers and two β-globin-heme monomers spontaneously associate to form the functional tetrameric hemoglobin molecule (α2β2). This forms the quaternary structure, which is essential for cooperative oxygen binding.\n\n**Summary:** The synthesis of hemoglobin involves the precise coordination of genetic information from DNA, its transcription into mRNA, translation into globin polypeptide chains on ribosomes, concurrent synthesis of heme, and finally, the assembly of these components into the functional tetrameric protein. This entire process is tightly regulated to ensure adequate hemoglobin production for oxygen transport.",
