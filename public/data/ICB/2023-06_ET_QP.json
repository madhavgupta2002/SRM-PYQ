The two main types are Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) and Ribonucleic Acid (RNA).\n\n**Common Features:**\n*   **Monomer:** Both are polymers of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose (5-carbon) sugar, and a phosphate group.\n*   **Nitrogenous Bases:** Purines (Adenine (A), Guanine (G)) and Pyrimidines (Cytosine (C), Thymine (T) in DNA, Uracil (U) in RNA).\n*   **Sugar-Phosphate Backbone:** Nucleotides are linked by phosphodiester bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, forming a sugar-phosphate backbone.\n\n**DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid):**\n*   **Sugar:** Deoxyribose.\n*   **Bases:** Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), Thymine (T).\n*   **Structure:** Typically a double helix, consisting of two antiparallel polynucleotide strands coiled around a central axis.

            "marks": 10,
            "answer": "Predicting protein secondary structure (alpha-helices, beta-sheets, turns, and coils) from its amino acid sequence is a crucial step in understanding protein function and for tertiary structure prediction. Several computational methods and tools have been developed:\n\n**Methods:**\n1.  **Statistical Methods (First Generation):** These methods, like Chou-Fasman and GOR (Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson), use statistical propensities of individual amino acids or short amino acid stretches to form specific secondary structures. They rely on experimentally determined frequencies of amino acids in different secondary structures. Accuracy is typically around 50-60%.\n2.  **Machine Learning Methods (Second & Third Generation):** These are more advanced and widely used, achieving higher accuracy (up to 80-85%).\n    *   **Neural Networks:** Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are trained on large datasets of proteins with known secondary structures. They learn complex patterns and relationships between amino acid sequences (often including evolutionary information from multiple sequence alignments) and their corresponding secondary structures. Examples include PHD, PSI-PRED.\n    *   **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** SVMs are supervised learning models that analyze data and recognize patterns. They can classify amino acid residues into different secondary structure states based on features derived from sequence windows.\n    *   **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs):** HMMs model the probability of an amino acid being in a particular secondary structure state and the probability of transitioning between states. They are good at handling sequence context.\n\n**Commonly Used Tools/Servers:**\n*   **PSI-PRED:** One of the most accurate and widely used secondary structure prediction servers. It uses a two-stage neural network that takes PSI-BLAST generated position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) as input, leveraging evolutionary information.\n*   **JPred:** A consensus-based method that combines predictions from several individual secondary structure prediction algorithms (e.g., JNet, PHD). It also incorporates evolutionary information from multiple sequence alignments.\n*   **GOR (Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson) Method:** While an older statistical method, it's foundational and still available in some suites. It considers information from a window of amino acids around the residue being predicted.\n*   **NPS@ (Network Protein Sequence Analysis):** A suite of tools, including various secondary structure predictors like PHD, DSC, GOR. It allows users to run multiple methods and compare results.\n*   **Porter/Porter 5:** Uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and considers a larger context of residues, often achieving high accuracy.\n\nThese tools typically output a prediction for each residue as 'H' (helix), 'E' (strand), or 'C' (coil/loop), along with a confidence score.",

            "marks": 10,
            "answer": "The humoral immune response is a component of the adaptive immune system characterized by the production of antibodies by B lymphocytes (B cells) to target and neutralize extracellular pathogens and their toxins. It involves several key steps:\n\n1.  **Antigen Recognition and B Cell Activation:**\n    *   **Direct Recognition:** B cells have B-cell receptors (BCRs, which are membrane-bound antibodies) on their surface. When a specific B cell encounters its cognate antigen (one that fits its BCR), it binds the antigen directly.\n    *   **Internalization and Processing:** The B cell internalizes the antigen, processes it into smaller peptide fragments, and presents these fragments on its surface via Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHC-II) molecules.\n\n2.  **T-Helper Cell (Th) Activation and Co-stimulation (for T-dependent antigens):**\n    *   For most antigens (T-dependent antigens), the B cell needs help from an activated T-helper (CD4+) cell. The T-helper cell recognizes the antigen presented on the B cell's MHC-II via its T-cell receptor (TCR).\n    *   This recognition, along with co-stimulatory signals (e.g., CD40L on T cell binding to CD40 on B cell), fully activates the B cell.\n\n3.  **Clonal Proliferation and Differentiation:**\n    *   Once activated, the B cell undergoes clonal proliferation, rapidly dividing to produce many identical copies (clones).\n    *   These clones differentiate into two main types of cells:\n        *   **Plasma Cells:** Antibody-secreting factories that produce large quantities of soluble antibodies (immunoglobulins) specific to the encountered antigen.\n        *   **Memory B Cells:** Long-lived cells that persist in the body, providing immunological memory. Upon re-exposure to the same antigen, these cells can quickly differentiate into plasma cells, leading to a faster and stronger secondary immune response.\n\n4.  **Antibody Effector Functions:**\n    *   Antibodies circulate in the blood and lymph, where they perform various functions to eliminate pathogens:\n        *   **Neutralization:** Antibodies bind directly to pathogens or toxins, preventing them from interacting with host cells.\n        *   **Opsonization:** Antibodies coat the surface of pathogens, marking them for phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils.\n        *   **Complement Activation:** Antibodies can activate the complement system, a cascade of proteins that leads to the lysis of pathogens or enhances phagocytosis.\n        *   **Antibody-Dependent Cell-mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC):** Antibodies bind to infected cells, signaling natural killer (NK) cells to kill them.\n        *   **Agglutination:** Antibodies can clump pathogens together, making them easier for phagocytes to engulf.\n\nIn summary, the humoral immune response effectively combats extracellular infections by producing specific antibodies that neutralize and eliminate pathogens, and establishes long-term memory for future protection.",

            "marks": 10,
            "answer": "Stem cells are undifferentiated biological cells that can differentiate into specialized cells and can divide to produce more stem cells. Their unique characteristics make them invaluable for various therapeutic and research applications.\n\n**Characteristics of Stem Cells:**\n1.  **Self-Renewal:** The ability to undergo numerous cycles of cell division while maintaining an undifferentiated state. This means they can produce more stem cells indefinitely.\n2.  **Potency:** The capacity to differentiate into various specialized cell types. Potency varies among different types of stem cells:\n    *   **Totipotent:** Can differentiate into all cell types, including embryonic and extraembryonic tissues (e.g., zygote, first few divisions).\n    *   **Pluripotent:** Can differentiate into all cell types of the three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm), but not extraembryonic tissues (e.g., embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells).\n    *   **Multipotent:** Can differentiate into a limited range of cell types within a specific lineage or tissue (e.g., hematopoietic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells).\n    *   **Oligopotent:** Can differentiate into a few cell types (e.g., lymphoid or myeloid stem cells).\n    *   **Unipotent:** Can differentiate into only one cell type, but have self-renewal capacity (e.g., muscle stem cells).\n\n**Uses of Stem Cells:**\n1.  **Regenerative Medicine and Cell Therapy:** The primary application is to repair or replace damaged tissues and organs. Examples include:\n    *   **Bone Marrow Transplants:** Hematopoietic stem cells are used to treat leukemia, lymphoma, and other blood disorders by regenerating a healthy blood and immune system.\n    *   **Cardiac Repair:** Research into using stem cells to regenerate heart muscle after heart attacks.\n    *   **Neurodegenerative Diseases:** Potential treatments for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and spinal cord injuries by replacing damaged neurons or supporting existing ones.\n    *   **Diabetes:** Developing pancreatic beta cells to produce insulin for type 1 diabetes.\n    *   **Burn Treatment:** Growing skin grafts from stem cells for severe burn victims.\n\n2.  **Disease Modeling and Drug Discovery:**\n    *   **In Vitro Models:** Stem cells, particularly iPSCs (induced pluripotent stem cells) derived from patients, can be differentiated into specific cell types (e.g., neurons, cardiomyocytes) to create 'disease in a dish' models.\n    *   **Drug Testing:** These models allow for screening new drugs, studying disease mechanisms, and understanding drug toxicity in a human-relevant context without animal testing.\n\n3.  **Developmental Biology Research:**\n    *   Studying the early stages of human development, cell differentiation, and organogenesis provides insights into congenital defects and basic biological processes.\n    *   Understanding the molecular mechanisms that control stem cell self-renewal and differentiation can lead to new therapeutic strategies.\n\n4.  **Gene Therapy:** Stem cells can be genetically modified to correct genetic defects and then transplanted back into the patient, offering a potential cure for genetic disorders.",

            "marks": 15,
            "answer": "When a vaccine is administered, it introduces a weakened or inactivated form of a pathogen (or parts of it, like proteins or genetic material) into the body without causing disease. The body's immune system recognizes these vaccine components as foreign antigens and mounts an immune response, leading to immunity and immunological memory. This process involves both innate and adaptive immune responses:\n\n1.  **Innate Immune Response (Initial Detection):**\n    *   **Antigen Presentation:** Antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells and macrophages, located at the vaccination site, engulf the vaccine antigens. They process these antigens and present peptide fragments on their surface via Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules (primarily MHC-II).\n    *   **Inflammation:** The vaccine components can activate innate immune receptors, leading to local inflammation, which helps recruit more immune cells to the site and enhances the overall response.\n\n2.  **Adaptive Immune Response (Specificity and Memory):**\n    *   **T Cell Activation:** Activated APCs migrate to lymph nodes, where they present the processed antigens to na\u00efve T lymphocytes. Specific CD4+ helper T cells (Th cells) that recognize the antigen become activated, proliferate, and differentiate into effector and memory Th cells.\n    *   **B Cell Activation and Antibody Production (Humoral Immunity):**\n        *   Na\u00efve B cells, with their specific B cell receptors, also encounter and bind to vaccine antigens.\n        *   With help from activated Th cells, these B cells become fully activated, proliferate, and differentiate into plasma cells and memory B cells.\n        *   Plasma cells are factories for producing large quantities of antibodies specific to the vaccine antigens. These antibodies circulate in the blood and lymph.\n    *   **Cytotoxic T Cell Activation (Cellular Immunity):** For some vaccines (especially those against intracellular pathogens or those that simulate a viral infection, like mRNA or viral vector vaccines), antigens might also be presented on MHC-I molecules, activating CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Activated CTLs can recognize and kill infected cells.\n\n3.  **Establishment of Immunological Memory:**\n    *   A critical outcome of vaccination is the generation of long-lived **memory B cells** and **memory T cells**. These cells persist in the body for months, years, or even a lifetime.\n    *   Memory cells are 'primed' to recognize the pathogen quickly and respond more robustly upon subsequent exposure to the actual pathogen (wild-type infection).\n\n4.  **Protective Immunity:**\n    *   Upon natural exposure to the actual pathogen after vaccination, the memory cells are rapidly activated. Memory B cells quickly differentiate into plasma cells to produce large amounts of high-affinity antibodies, while memory T cells proliferate and mount a rapid cellular response.\n    *   This rapid and strong **secondary immune response** typically neutralizes or eliminates the pathogen before it can cause significant disease symptoms, thus providing protection.\n\nIn essence, vaccination safely \"educates\" the immune system by exposing it to harmless antigens, allowing it to develop specific antibodies and memory cells without the risk of illness. This prepares the body to effectively fight off future infections by the real pathogen.",

            "marks": 15,
            "answer": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting the motor system, characterized by symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia (slowed movement), and postural instability.\n\n**Cause with Respect to Neurons:**\nAt its core, Parkinson's disease is caused by the progressive degeneration and death of specific neurons in a region of the brain called the **substantia nigra pars compacta** (SNpc). These neurons are dopaminergic, meaning they produce and release the neurotransmitter dopamine. The SNpc forms a crucial part of the basal ganglia, a group of structures involved in controlling voluntary movements. When dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc degenerate, there is a significant reduction in dopamine supply to the striatum (a part of the basal ganglia), leading to the characteristic motor symptoms.\n\nKey neuronal aspects contributing to the cause:\n*   **Dopaminergic Neuron Loss:** The hallmark pathological feature is the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the SNpc, which can reach up to 70-80% before motor symptoms become apparent.\n*   **Lewy Bodies:** The presence of abnormal protein aggregates called Lewy bodies within the surviving neurons of the SNpc and other brain regions. These Lewy bodies are primarily composed of misfolded alpha-synuclein protein, which clumps together. The accumulation of alpha-synuclein is believed to be central to neuronal dysfunction and death.\n*   **Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Oxidative Stress:** Damaged mitochondria and increased oxidative stress are implicated in the death of dopaminergic neurons. Neurons are highly metabolically active and vulnerable to oxidative damage.\n*   **Neuroinflammation:** Chronic inflammation involving microglia (immune cells of the brain) and astrocytes is observed in the brains of PD patients and is thought to contribute to neurodegeneration.\n*   **Genetic Factors:** While most cases are sporadic, several genetic mutations (e.g., in *SNCA* (alpha-synuclein), *LRRK2*, *PARK2*, *PINK1* genes) are linked to familial forms of PD, providing insights into the molecular pathways involved in neuronal health and degradation.\n\n**Effect of the Disease on the Body (Symptoms):**\nThe degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and the resulting dopamine deficiency in the striatum directly lead to the primary motor symptoms:\n1.  **Bradykinesia (Slowness of Movement):** Difficulty initiating movement and slowness in executing voluntary movements. This affects daily activities like walking, writing (micrographia), and facial expressions (mask-like face).\n2.  **Rigidity (Stiffness):** Increased muscle tone, leading to stiffness and inflexibility of limbs and trunk. This can result in a \"cogwheel\" rigidity (a ratchet-like resistance to passive movement).\n3.  **Tremor at Rest:** Involuntary rhythmic shaking, typically starting in a limb (often a hand or finger) at rest, and usually subsiding with voluntary movement.\n4.  **Postural Instability:** Impaired balance and coordination, leading to an increased risk of falls. This often manifests as a stooped posture.\n\nIn addition to motor symptoms, PD also has significant non-motor effects, which often precede motor symptoms and can profoundly impact quality of life:\n*   **Cognitive Impairment:** Problems with executive function, memory, attention, and eventually dementia in later stages.\n*   **Mood Disorders:** Depression, anxiety, and apathy are very common.\n*   **Sleep Disturbances:** Insomnia, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and excessive daytime sleepiness.\n*   **Autonomic Dysfunction:** Constipation, orthostatic hypotension (drop in blood pressure upon standing), urinary problems, and sweating abnormalities.\n*   **Sensory Symptoms:** Loss of smell (anosmia), pain, and numbness.\n\nUnderstanding the specific neuronal pathology in the substantia nigra, primarily the loss of dopamine-producing neurons and the accumulation of alpha-synuclein, is crucial for developing therapies to slow, halt, or reverse the progression of Parkinson's disease.",
