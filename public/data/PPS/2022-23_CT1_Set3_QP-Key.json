A variable, on the other hand, is an entity whose value may change during the course of program execution.",

There are two types of header files:\n\n\u27a4 The files that the programmer writes (user defined)\n\u27a4 The files that comes with your compiler.(System header files)\n\nEach header file contains information (or declarations) for a particular group of functions. Like stdio.h header file contains declarations of standard input and output functions available in C which is used for get the input and print the output. Similarly, the header file math.h contains declarations of mathematical functions available in C.\n\nWhen we want to use any function in our c program then first we need to import their definition from c library, for importing their declaration and definition we need to include header file in program by using #include. Header file include at the top of any C program.",
