            "marks": 1,
            "answer": "b. Science\nExplanation: Engineering is fundamentally the application of scientific principles and mathematical tools to design, build, and maintain structures, machines, systems, and processes. It relies heavily on scientific knowledge to understand the natural world and develop solutions to real-world problems. While philosophy informs the ethical and conceptual frameworks of engineering, and literature and sports are related to broader human experience, science provides the core knowledge base.",

            "marks": 1,
            "answer": "b. Medieval\nExplanation: While aqueducts are most famously associated with the Roman Empire (Ancient period), which largely predates the Medieval period, the question also includes \"advanced civil structures widely constructed.\" The Medieval period (roughly 500-1500 AD) saw extensive construction of advanced civil structures for its time, such as large cathedrals, castles, fortified cities, and complex water management systems (though less focused on aqueducts than the Romans). Among the given options, Medieval represents a period of significant and widespread civil construction following the prehistoric era, and preceding the Renaissance and Modern eras. If \"Ancient\" or \"Roman\" were options, they would be stronger for aqueducts specifically, but considering the broader term \"advanced civil structures,\" Medieval is the most appropriate choice from the given list.",

            "marks": 1,
            "answer": "c. Expertise in literature\nExplanation: Engineers are primarily known for creative problem-solving (finding innovative solutions), strong analytical skills (breaking down complex problems), and systems thinking (understanding how parts interact within a whole system). While good communication skills are important for engineers, deep expertise in literature is not a core or typically associated attribute, unlike the other options which are fundamental to engineering practice.",

            "marks": 1,
            "answer": "b. By providing aesthetic and creative elements\nExplanation: Art, as part of the STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) framework, contributes significantly to engineering by fostering creativity, enhancing design aesthetics, and encouraging innovative approaches to problem-solving. It helps engineers consider the human experience, usability, and visual appeal of their creations, moving beyond purely functional aspects. It does not ensure strict rules, reduce scientific knowledge, or eliminate technology.",

Helps engineers perform accurate calculations and analyses\nC. Provides the artistic perspective to design\nd. Helps engineers communicate with the public",
            "marks": 1,
            "answer": "b. Helps engineers perform accurate calculations and analyses\nExplanation: Mathematics is an essential tool in engineering, providing the framework for quantitative analysis, modeling, and precise calculations. It enables engineers to predict performance, ensure structural integrity, optimize designs, and make informed decisions, all crucial for the accuracy and reliability of engineered solutions. While communication (d) is vital, mathematics' primary role is analytical and computational.",

            "marks": 1,
            "answer": "c. Product Growth\nExplanation: The standard stages of a Product Life Cycle (PLC) typically include Introduction, Growth, Maturity, and Decline. 'Product Growth' is explicitly one of these primary stages, characterized by increasing sales and market share. 'Product Realization' is a broader process of bringing a product to market, 'Product Innovation' is an activity, and while 'Product Termination' relates to the end of a product's life (the Decline stage), 'Product Growth' is a more direct and universally recognized stage name.",
