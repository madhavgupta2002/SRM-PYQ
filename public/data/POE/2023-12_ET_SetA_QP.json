            "marks": 10,
            "answer": "Assuming 'PLC' refers to the **Product Life Cycle** as indicated by the syllabus, it is a concept in business and engineering that describes the stages a product goes through from its introduction to its eventual withdrawal from the market. It's a strategic tool used for product management, marketing, and engineering design considerations.\n\nThe typical Product Life Cycle consists of four main stages:\n\n1.  **Introduction Stage:**\n    *   **Illustration:** Imagine a brand-new smartphone model being launched. It's heavily advertised, but sales are initially slow as customers are unaware or hesitant.\n    *   **Explanation:** This stage begins when a new product is first made available for purchase. Marketing efforts are focused on raising awareness and driving initial trials. Production might be low, and costs (R&D, marketing) are high, often leading to losses. Engineers are typically involved in refining the product, addressing early design flaws, and scaling up production methods.\n\n2.  **Growth Stage:**\n    *   **Illustration:** The smartphone gains popularity. Sales rapidly increase, and competitors might start to emerge with similar products. The company focuses on expanding distribution.\n    *   **Explanation:** If the product is successful, sales volume grows rapidly. Production efficiency improves, and economies of scale may reduce costs. Profits begin to rise. Marketing shifts to building brand loyalty and differentiating from competitors. Engineers might work on adding new features, improving manufacturing processes, and expanding product variations.\n\n3.  **Maturity Stage:**\n    *   **Illustration:** The smartphone is now a well-established product. Sales growth slows down and eventually plateaus. The market is saturated, and competition is intense. Companies might offer discounts or minor updates.\n    *   **Explanation:** Sales reach their peak and then start to stabilize or decline slightly. The market is highly competitive, and profit margins may shrink due to price pressure. Companies focus on market share maintenance, product differentiation (e.g., through minor improvements or branding), and cost reduction. Engineers might focus on value engineering, process optimization, and developing next-generation products.\n\n4.  **Decline Stage:**\n    *   **Illustration:** A newer, more advanced smartphone model from the same or a different company enters the market, and the original model's sales significantly drop. The company might discontinue it.\n    *   **Explanation:** Sales and profits steadily decline. This can be due to new technologies, changing consumer preferences, increased competition, or market saturation. Companies might decide to discontinue the product, liquidate remaining stock, or harvest remaining profits with minimal investment. Engineers may be involved in end-of-life planning, recycling, or re-purposing components.\n\nUnderstanding the Product Life Cycle helps engineers and businesses make informed decisions regarding design, production, marketing, and strategic investment at each stage.",

            "marks": 10,
            "answer": "John Holland's Theory of Vocational Choice, often referred to as the RIASEC theory, is one of the most widely known and researched theories of career counseling. Proposed by psychologist John L. Holland in 1959, the theory posits that career choice and satisfaction are primarily a function of the match between an individual's personality type and the characteristics of their work environment.\n\nHolland's theory is based on four core assumptions:\n\n1.  **Most people can be categorized as one of six personality types:** Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional (RIASEC).\n2.  **There are six corresponding work environments:** Each environment is dominated by people of the corresponding personality type and offers activities suited to that type.\n3.  **People search for environments that allow them to exercise their skills and abilities and to express their attitudes and values.** They seek roles that are congruent with their personality.\n4.  **Behavior is determined by an interaction between personality and environment.** The degree of fit between an individual's personality type and their work environment predicts job satisfaction, stability, and achievement.\n\n**The Six Holland Codes (RIASEC Types and Environments):**\n\n*   **Realistic (R):** \"Doers\" - Practical, hands-on, physically active, prefer working with tools, machines, or animals. They enjoy concrete tasks and prefer objective, tangible results. *Environments:* Trades, engineering, agriculture, military.\n*   **Investigative (I):** \"Thinkers\" - Analytical, intellectual, scientific, curious, independent. They enjoy solving complex problems, conducting research, and working with ideas rather than people. *Environments:* Research, science, medicine, technology.\n*   **Artistic (A):** \"Creators\" - Creative, intuitive, imaginative, emotional, expressive. They enjoy self-expression, unstructured tasks, and working with forms, designs, and patterns. *Environments:* Arts, music, writing, design.\n*   **Social (S):** \"Helpers\" - Helpful, empathetic, cooperative, understanding, responsible. They enjoy interacting with people, teaching, counseling, and providing service. *Environments:* Education, healthcare, social work, counseling.\n*   **Enterprising (E):** \"Persuaders\" - Energetic, ambitious, confident, sociable, assertive. They enjoy leadership, influencing others, and pursuing economic or organizational goals. *Environments:* Business, sales, management, law.\n*   **Conventional (C):** \"Organizers\" - Orderly, meticulous, conscientious, efficient, practical. They enjoy structured tasks, working with data and numbers, and following procedures. *Environments:* Administration, accounting, finance, data entry.\n\n**Key Concepts in Holland's Theory:**\n\n*   **Congruence:** The degree of fit between a person's personality type and their work environment. High congruence predicts greater satisfaction and stability.\n*   **Differentiation:** The clarity of an individual's personality profile. A highly differentiated person clearly fits one or two types, while an undifferentiated person has equally strong interests in many types.\n*   **Consistency:** The degree of relatedness between a person's dominant personality types. Some types are more psychologically similar (e.g., Realistic and Investigative) than others (e.g., Realistic and Social).\n*   **Identity:** The clarity and stability of a person's goals, interests, and talents.\n\nHolland's theory is widely used in career assessments (e.g., Strong Interest Inventory, Self-Directed Search) to help individuals understand their interests and identify suitable career paths that align with their personality, thereby promoting greater career satisfaction and success.",
