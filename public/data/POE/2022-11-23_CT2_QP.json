            "marks": 10,
            "answer": "The Product Life Cycle (PLC) describes the stages a product goes through from its introduction to its eventual withdrawal from the market. It typically has four main stages:\n\n1.  **Introduction:** This is the initial launch stage. Sales are low, costs are high (due to R&D, marketing, and distribution setup), and profits are often negative or low. The focus is on building product awareness and establishing a market presence.\n2.  **Growth:** If the product gains acceptance, sales grow rapidly, and profits increase significantly. Competitors may start to enter the market. The company aims to maximize market share, improve product features, and expand distribution.\n3.  **Maturity:** Sales growth slows down and eventually peaks or plateaus. The market becomes saturated, competition is intense, and pricing often becomes a key differentiator. Profits may start to decline due to increased competition and lower margins. Companies focus on differentiating their product, maintaining market share, and reducing costs.\n4.  **Decline:** Sales and profits steadily decrease. This stage occurs due to factors like technological advancements, changing consumer tastes, or new substitute products. Companies may decide to discontinue the product, liquidate remaining stock, or find niche markets.\n\n**Example: Smartwatch**\n*   **Introduction (early 2010s):** Early smartwatches (e.g., Pebble, Samsung Gear 1) were introduced with limited functionality, high prices, and a small customer base. High R&D and marketing costs.\n*   **Growth (mid-2010s):** Apple Watch's launch and subsequent improvements, along with other brands, led to rapid market growth. Features expanded, prices became more competitive, and consumer adoption increased significantly.\n*   **Maturity (late 2010s - present):** The smartwatch market is now mature. Many players offer a wide range of devices. Sales are steady but growth has slowed. Companies focus on incremental innovations, health features, and brand loyalty.\n*   **Decline:** Individual older models of smartwatches (e.g., Apple Watch Series 1) enter decline as newer, more advanced versions are released, making the older models obsolete or less desirable.",

            "marks": 10,
            "answer": "**Mind Mapping**\nMind mapping is a visual thinking tool used to organize information, brainstorm ideas, plan projects, and solve problems. It is a diagrammatic representation that starts with a central topic or idea, from which main branches radiate, and further sub-branches detail associated concepts. Key characteristics of mind mapping include:\n\n*   **Central Idea:** The main subject or topic is placed at the center.\n*   **Main Branches:** Key themes or categories related to the central idea branch out from it.\n*   **Keywords and Images:** Each branch typically uses single keywords, short phrases, or images to represent concepts, making it concise and visually stimulating.\n*   **Connections:** Lines, colors, and varying branch thickness are used to show relationships, hierarchy, and emphasis.\n*   **Non-linear Structure:** It encourages free-flowing thought and creativity, unlike traditional linear note-taking.\n\n**Engineering Example: Design of a Smart Home System**\nImagine an engineer needs to design a smart home system. A mind map for this project could look like this:\n\n*   **Central Topic:** Smart Home System Design\n\n*   **Main Branches:**\n    *   **Core Functions:** (branches out) Lighting Control, Climate Control, Security, Entertainment, Energy Management\n    *   **Hardware Components:** (branches out) Sensors (Motion, Temperature, Door/Window), Actuators (Smart Bulbs, Thermostats, Smart Locks), Central Hub (Raspberry Pi, Dedicated Controller), Network Devices (Router, Wi-Fi Extenders)\n    *   **Software & Connectivity:** (branches out) Operating System (Linux, Custom OS), Communication Protocols (Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth), User Interface (Mobile App, Voice Assistant), Cloud Services\n    *   **User Experience (UX):** (branches out) Ease of Use, Customization, Accessibility, Aesthetics\n    *   **Security & Privacy:** (branches out) Data Encryption, Authentication, Vulnerability Testing, User Data Policy\n    *   **Power Management:** (branches out) Power Consumption, Battery Backup, Energy Efficiency Algorithms\n    *   **Cost & Budget:** (branches out) Component Sourcing, Manufacturing, Installation, Maintenance\n\n*   **Sub-branches (example for 'Lighting Control'):** (from Lighting Control) On/Off, Dimming, Color Change, Schedules, Motion-Activated\n\nThis visual structure helps the engineer quickly grasp the scope, identify key areas, and brainstorm solutions in a structured yet flexible manner.",

            "answer": "**Differentiation between Epistemology of Engineering and Ontology of Engineering**\n\n**Ontology of Engineering**\n*   **Definition:** Ontology, in philosophy, is the study of being and existence. In engineering, the ontology of engineering deals with *what exists* or *what are the fundamental entities, concepts, and relationships* within the engineering domain. It defines the vocabulary and structure of knowledge about a specific engineering system or domain.\n*   **Key Question:** \"What *is* engineering?\" or \"What are the constituent parts and principles of an engineered system?\"\n*   **Focus:** Categorization, classification, and conceptual modeling of objects, processes, and phenomena relevant to engineering. It aims to create a shared understanding of the domain's 'things'.\n*   **Example:** When an engineer designs a bridge, the ontology would define what a \"bridge\" is, its essential components (deck, piers, abutments, cables), their properties (material strength, load-bearing capacity), and how these components are structurally related to form the whole. It describes the *elements* and their inherent properties that make up the engineered world.\n\n**Epistemology of Engineering**\n*   **Definition:** Epistemology is the study of knowledge. In engineering, the epistemology of engineering deals with *how engineers know what they know* and *how they acquire, justify, and validate knowledge* in their practice. It concerns the methods, sources, and limitations of engineering knowledge.\n*   **Key Question:** \"How do engineers *know*?\" or \"How is engineering knowledge created, evaluated, and used?\"\n*   **Focus:** The processes of knowing, designing, problem-solving, decision-making, and validating solutions. It investigates the methods used to gain reliable knowledge, such as experimentation, modeling, simulation, analysis, and experience.\n*   **Example:** For the same bridge design, the epistemology would focus on *how* engineers determine the bridge will be safe and functional. This involves applying mathematical formulas, using finite element analysis software, conducting material tests, adhering to building codes and standards, consulting past project data, and iterative design reviews. It describes the *methods and justifications* used to ensure the knowledge applied is sound and the resulting design is valid.\n\n**Key Differences:**\n*   **Ontology:** Focuses on the *nature of entities* (the 'what'). It defines the components and relationships of the engineering world.\n*   **Epistemology:** Focuses on the *nature of knowledge* (the 'how'). It describes the methods by which engineers gain, validate, and apply knowledge about those entities.",
