            "marks": 6,
            "answer": "The primary difference between open-loop and closed-loop cycles (or control systems) lies in the presence and utilization of **feedback**:\n\n1.  **Open-Loop Cycle:**\n    *   **Definition:** A system where the output is not measured or fed back into the input for adjustment. The control action is independent of the output.\n    *   **Characteristics:** Simple in design and less costly. Less accurate and reliable because it cannot correct for disturbances or changes in the system or environment. Requires careful calibration.\n    *   **Example:** A toaster. You set a time, and it toasts for that duration regardless of how well done the toast actually is. A washing machine that runs on a timer.\n\n2.  **Closed-Loop Cycle (Feedback Control System):**\n    *   **Definition:** A system where the output is measured and compared to a desired setpoint (input). The difference (error signal) is then used to adjust the control action to bring the output closer to the desired value.\n    *   **Characteristics:** More complex and typically more expensive. Highly accurate, reliable, and robust against disturbances and variations. Self-correcting.\n    *   **Example:** A thermostat in a room. It measures the current room temperature (output), compares it to the desired temperature (setpoint), and turns the heater/AC on or off to reduce the difference. A car's cruise control system.\n\nIn essence, open-loop systems operate \"blindly\" based on pre-programmed instructions, while closed-loop systems \"see\" what's happening and adjust their actions accordingly.",

            "marks": 10,
            "answer": "**Ontology** is a branch of philosophy that studies the fundamental nature of being, existence, reality, and the categories of being. In computer science and engineering, an ontology is a formal and explicit representation of a shared understanding of a domain. It defines a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain and the relationships between them. It's essentially a way to model the world (or a specific part of it) to enable clear communication and reasoning.\n\n**Key Components of an Ontology:**\n*   **Classes/Concepts:** Abstract groups, sets, or collections of objects. (e.g., Car, Engine, Wheel).\n*   **Individuals/Instances:** Specific objects belonging to a class. (e.g., \"My Honda Civic\" is an instance of \"Car\").\n*   **Attributes/Properties:** Features, characteristics, or parameters that objects can have. (e.g., \"Car\" has attribute \"Color\").\n*   **Relations/Relationships:** Ways in which concepts or individuals can be related to one another. (e.g., \"Car has-a Engine\", \"Engine is-part-of Car\").\n\n**Example: Ontology for \"Vehicles\" (Conceptual Sketch)**\n\n```\n      +-------------------+\n      |      Vehicle      |\n      +-------------------+\n             /  |  \\\n           /    |    \\  (is-a)\n  (is-a) /      |      \\       \n       /        |        \\\n+--------+   +--------+   +--------+\n|  Car   |   |  Truck |   | Bicycle|\n+--------+   +--------+   +--------+\n   |                      |\n   |                      | (has-a)\n   | (has-a)              |\n   |                      |\n+--------+             +--------+\n| Engine |             |  Frame |\n+--------+             +--------+\n   |                      |\n   | (has-parts)          | (made-of)\n   |                      |\n+-------+             +-------+\n| Piston|             | Metal |\n+-------+             +-------+\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Sketch:**\n*   **Central Concept:** \"Vehicle\" is the top-level concept.\n*   **Classes:** \"Car\", \"Truck\", \"Bicycle\" are subclasses of \"Vehicle\" (indicated by \"is-a\" relationship, meaning a Car *is a* Vehicle). \"Engine\", \"Frame\", \"Piston\", \"Metal\" are other classes.\n*   **Relationships:**\n    *   `is-a`: Denotes a subclass-superclass relationship (e.g., Car `is-a` Vehicle).\n    *   `has-a`: Denotes a part-whole relationship or property (e.g., Car `has-a` Engine, Bicycle `has-a` Frame).\n    *   `has-parts`: A more specific part-whole (e.g., Engine `has-parts` Piston).\n    *   `made-of`: Describes a material composition (e.g., Frame `made-of` Metal).\n\nThis sketch visually represents the concepts and their connections within the domain of \"Vehicles.\" It provides a structured vocabulary and a set of relationships that can be used for consistent information modeling, data integration, and automated reasoning in engineering applications like product design, manufacturing, or supply chain management.
