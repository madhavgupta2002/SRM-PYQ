            "marks": 5,
            "answer": "In the discussion of engineering knowledge it is helpful to think of engineering as comprising four major dimensions (Fig. 1): the dimensions of the basic sciences, of the social sciences, of design, and of practical accomplishment. This lets us think of the engineer as a professional who combines, in variable proportions, the qualities of a scientist, a sociologist, a designer, and a doer.\n\n[Image description: A diagram showing four quadrants: Top-left: SOCIAL SCIENCES (engineer as sociologist); Top-right: BASIC SCIENCES (engineer as scientist); Bottom-left: DESIGN (engineer as designer); Bottom-right: PRACTICAL REALIZATION (engineer as doer)]\n\nThe dimension inspired by the basic sciences views engineering as the application of the natural and exact sciences, stressing the values of logics and rigour, and seeing knowledge is produced through analysis and experimentation. Research is the preferred modus operandi of this dimension, where the discovery of first principles is seen as the activity leading to higher recognition. The social dimension of engineering sees engineers not just as technologists, but also as social experts, in their ability to recognize the eminently social nature of the world they act upon and the social complexity of the teams they belong to. The creation of social and economic value and the belief in the satisfaction of end users emerge as central values in this dimension of engineering. 3 marks\n\nThe design dimension sees engineering as the art of design. It values systems thinking much more than the analytical thinking that characterizes traditional science. Its practice is founded on holistic, contextual, and integrated visions of the world, rather than on partial visions. Typical values of this dimension include exploring alternatives and compromising. In this dimension, which resorts frequently to non-scientific forms of thinking, the key decisions are often based on incomplete knowledge and intuition, as well as on personal and collective experiences. The fourth mode views engineering as the art of getting things done, valuing the ability to change the world and overcoming complexity with flexibility and perseverance. It corresponds to the art of the homo faber, in its purest expression, and to the ability to tuck up one's sleeves and get down to the nitty-gritty. In this dimension, the completed job, which stands before the world, leads to higher recognition. [2 marks]",

            "marks": 5,
            "answer": "John Holland theorized that personality and work environment are measurable, and that the two should be matched in order to find a satisfying career. Holland's theory describes six basic personality types (RIASEC, described below). One type is typically dominant; an individual's top three types -- in order -- make up that person's Holland Code. The goal is to match an individual's code, or personality type, with his or her career.\n\n[Image description: A hexagonal diagram with 'C' (Conventional Organizers), 'R' (Realistic Doers), 'I' (Investigative Thinkers), 'A' (Artistic Creators), 'S' (Social Helpers), 'E' (Enterprising Persuaders) arranged clockwise.

Like to repair and work with tools, machines, or animals; outdoor work is often preferred. Prefer problems are concrete rather than abstract; want practical solutions that can be acted out. Characteristics include stable, assertive, physical strength, practical. Holland typology: realistic practical frank nature lover curious concrete selfcontrolled ambitious persistent athletic mechanical thrifty stable reserved independent systematic.\n\nInvestigative - I (Thinkers)\nTend to focus on ideas. Like to collect and analyze data and information of all kinds. Curious and tend to be creative and original. Task oriented and motivated by analyzing and researching. Tend to prefer loosely structured situations with minimal rules or regulations. Prefer to think through rather than act out problems. Characteristics include reserved, independent, analytical, logical. Holland typology: investigative inquisitive scientific precise cautious self-confident reserved independent analytical observant scholarly curious introspective broad-minded logical.\n\nArtistic - A (Creators)\nCreative and tend to focus on self-expression through all kinds of mediums: materials, music and words, as well as systems and programs. Able to see possibilities in various settings and are not afraid to experiment with their ideas. Like variety and tend to feel cramped in structured situations. Deal with problems in intuitive, expressive, and independent ways. Tend to be adverse to rules. Characteristics include intuitive, creative, expressive, unconventional. Holland typology: artistic creative imaginative unconventional independent original impulsive courageous complicated nonconforming intuitive innovative emotional expressive introspective sensitive open idealistic.\n\nSocial - S (Helpers)\nConcerned with people and their welfare. Tend to have well developed communications skills and like to help, encourage, counsel, guide, train, or facilitate others. Enjoy working with groups or individuals, using empathy and an ability to identify and solve problems. Value cooperation and consensus. Deal with problems through feelings. Flexible approach to problems. Characteristics include humanistic, verbal, interpersonal, responsible. Holland typology: social friendly idealistic outgoing cooperative responsible kind persuasive patient helpful insightful understanding generous forgiving empathetic.\n\nEnterprising - E (Persuaders)\nWork with and through people, providing leadership and delegating responsibilities for organizational and/or financial gain. Goal-oriented and want to see results. Tend to function with a high degree of energy. Prefer business settings, and often want social events to have a purpose beyond socializing. Attack problems with leadership skills. Decision-Maker. Characteristics include persuasive, confident, demonstrate leadership, interest in power/status. Holland typology: enterprising self-confident sociable enthusiastic adventurous impulsive inquisitive talkative spontaneous assertive persuasive energetic popular ambitious optimistic extroverted.\n\nConventional - C (Organizers)\n\u2022 Like to pay a lot of attention to detail and organization, and prefer to work with data, particularly in the numerical, statistical, and record-keeping realm. Have a high sense of responsibility, follow the rules, and want to know precisely what is expected. Prefer clearly defined, practical problems and to solve problems by applying rules. Oriented to carrying out tasks initiated by others. Characteristics include conscientious, efficient, concern for rules and regulation, orderly. Holland typology: conventional well-organized accurate numerically-inclined methodical efficient orderly thrifty structured ambitious persistent conscientious conforming practical systematic polite obedient. 2 marks",

There are interconnections indicated where experimental data from scientific method can become background research for new/future engineering projects, and engineering solutions can lead to new scientific questions.\n] 3 marks, Either table or diagram\n\nIn real life, the distinction between science and engineering is not always clear. Scientists often do some engineering work, and engineers frequently apply scientific principles, including the scientific method. Much of what we often call \"computer science\" is actually engineering\u2014programmers creating new products. Your project may fall in the gray area between science and engineering, and that's OK. Many projects, even if related to engineering, can and should use the scientific method.\n\nHowever, if the objective of your project is to invent a new product, computer program, experience, or environment, then it makes sense to follow the engineering design process. 2 Marks",
