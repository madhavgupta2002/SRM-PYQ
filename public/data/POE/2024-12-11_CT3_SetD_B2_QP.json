Analyze Data and Draw Conclusions\n6. Results Align with Hypothesis / Results Align Partially or Not at All with Hypothesis\n7. Communicate Results\n(Note: Experimental data becomes background research for new/future project. Ask new question, form new hypothesis, experiment again if results align partially or not at all.)\n\nEngineering Method Process (as depicted in the PDF flowchart):\n1. Define the Problem\n2. Do Background Research\n3. Specify Requirements\n4. Brainstorm, Evaluate, and Choose Solution\n5. Develop and Prototype Solution\n6.
