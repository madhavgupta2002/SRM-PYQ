            "answer": "The term STEM gained significant prominence and governmental focus in the United States around the early 2000s, with various initiatives and reports, such as those from the National Science Foundation, emphasizing its importance. Many sources point to the early 2000s as the period of the acronym's rise in policy contexts, with some specifically citing a 2001 National Science Foundation report. Thus, (b) 2001 is a plausible answer reflecting this period of introduction for competitive improvement.",

            "answer": "Curiosity, Open-Mindedness, and Systems Thinking are widely recognized as cognitive 'habits of mind' that foster deep learning and problem-solving. Collaboration, while an essential skill and practice in learning and professional environments, is typically considered a social or interpersonal skill rather than an intrinsic cognitive 'habit of mind' itself. Therefore, (d) Collaboration is generally not classified as a learning habit of mind in the same context as the others.",

            "answer": "**Science:**\nScience is the systematic study of the natural and physical world through observation, experimentation, and theoretical explanation. Its primary goal is to discover fundamental truths, laws, and principles governing phenomena, often driven by curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. Scientists ask \"Why?\" and \"How does it work?\".\n\n**Technology:**\nTechnology is the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes. It involves the creation of tools, techniques, systems, and processes to solve practical problems, fulfill human needs, or extend human capabilities. Technology takes scientific discoveries and translates them into functional products or methods. Technologists ask \"What can be made or done with this knowledge?\".\n\n**Engineering:**\nEngineering is the creative application of scientific principles, mathematical methods, and practical experience to design, build, maintain, and improve structures, machines, systems, and processes. Engineers apply scientific and technological knowledge to develop innovative solutions for real-world problems, considering constraints such as cost, safety, feasibility, and environmental impact. Engineers ask \"How can we design and implement a solution to a problem using scientific and technological tools?\".\n\n**Differentiation:**\n*   **Goal:** Science seeks to *understand* the natural world; Technology seeks to *create tools/products* from that understanding; Engineering seeks to *design and implement solutions* using both scientific understanding and technological tools.\n*   **Focus:** Science is concerned with discovery and explaining \"what is\"; Technology is concerned with invention and demonstrating \"what can be\"; Engineering is concerned with design and construction, addressing \"what should be\" built and \"how\".\n*   **Methodology:** Science employs observation, experimentation, and theory development; Technology involves innovation, development, and application; Engineering utilizes design methodologies, analysis, synthesis, and optimization.\n*   **Relationship:** Science provides the foundational knowledge that both technology and engineering build upon. Technology offers the tools, materials, and processes that engineers use in their designs. Engineering, in turn, often identifies new problems or needs that drive further scientific research and technological innovation. They are deeply interconnected but distinct in their primary objectives and approaches.",

            "marks": 10,
            "answer": "This question offers two options:\n\n**Option 1: Desired Attributes of an Engineer**\nDesired attributes of an engineer are the essential qualities, skills, and characteristics that enable them to succeed in their profession, contribute to society, and navigate complex challenges. These include:\n1.  **Problem-Solving Skills:** The ability to identify, analyze, and effectively solve complex problems using systematic and creative approaches.\n2.  **Strong Technical Competence:** A solid foundation in mathematics, natural sciences, and core engineering principles relevant to their specific discipline.\n3.  **Creativity and Innovation:** The capacity to develop novel solutions, improve existing designs, and think innovatively to address new challenges.\n4.  **Critical Thinking:** The ability to evaluate information objectively, analyze arguments, synthesize data, and make reasoned judgments.\n5.  **Communication Skills:** Proficiency in conveying technical information clearly and concisely through written, verbal, and graphical means to diverse audiences.\n6.  **Teamwork and Collaboration:** The ability to work effectively within multidisciplinary teams, contributing to shared goals, respecting diverse perspectives, and leveraging collective intelligence.\n7.  **Ethical Conduct and Professionalism:** Adherence to a strong code of ethics, demonstrating integrity, responsibility, and a commitment to public safety, welfare, and environmental sustainability.\n8.  **Adaptability and Lifelong Learning:** A willingness to continuously acquire new knowledge, skills, and technologies, and to adapt to evolving industry standards and societal needs.\n9.  **Systems Thinking:** The capability to understand how individual components interact within a larger system and to consider the broader context and implications of engineering designs.\n10. **Resourcefulness and Resilience:** The ability to find alternative solutions under constraints, manage resources effectively, and persist through setbacks and challenges.\n\n**Option 2: Engineering Habits of Mind (EHoM)**\nEngineering Habits of Mind (EHoM) are cognitive and practical dispositions that characterize how engineers approach problems, think creatively, and make decisions. They are intellectual tools that facilitate effective engineering practice. Key EHoM include:\n1.  **Systems Thinking:** Approaching problems by considering the interconnectedness of various components and understanding how a change in one part affects the entire system, its environment, and its lifecycle.\n2.  **Optimizing:** Continuously seeking to find the best possible solution or design within a set of constraints (e.g., cost, time, materials, performance, sustainability), often involving trade-offs and iterative refinement.\n3.  **Creative Problem-Solving:** Generating innovative and novel solutions to complex challenges, often involving divergent thinking, exploring multiple possibilities, and challenging conventional approaches.\n4.  **Visualizing and Modeling:** Using abstract representations, sketches, diagrams, simulations, and prototypes to conceptualize, analyze, communicate, and test designs and ideas.\n5.  **Iterative Design:** Understanding that design is rarely a linear process but a cyclical one involving planning, building, testing, analyzing, and refining solutions based on feedback and results.\n6.  **Ethical Consideration:** Routinely reflecting on the societal, environmental, economic, and ethical implications of engineering designs and decisions throughout the entire project lifecycle.\n7.  **Attention to Detail and Precision:** Ensuring accuracy, thoroughness, and quality in all aspects of design, analysis, calculations, and implementation to ensure reliability and safety.\n8.  **Collaboration:** Working effectively with diverse individuals and teams, sharing knowledge, communicating clearly, and leveraging collective intelligence to achieve common goals.\n9.  **Risk Assessment:** Identifying potential failures, evaluating their likelihood and impact, and designing solutions that mitigate risks, ensure safety, and improve reliability.\n10. **Abstracting from the Real World:** The ability to simplify complex real-world problems into manageable, abstract models, solve them using theoretical or computational methods, and then translate the solutions back to the real context.",
