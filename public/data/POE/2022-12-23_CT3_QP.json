            "marks": 1,
            "answer": "The correct option is a. Scientific method.\n\nExplanation:\nIn the scientific method, the process typically involves forming a hypothesis (an educated guess or proposed explanation), designing an experiment to test it, conducting the experiment, collecting data, analyzing the results, and then drawing conclusions to either support or refute the hypothesis. This cyclical process is fundamental to scientific inquiry. Engineering design, while also systematic, focuses more on creating solutions to problems, often starting with defining requirements and moving through conceptual design, detailed design, implementation, and testing, rather than primarily testing a hypothesis about natural phenomena.",

            "answer": "The correct option is d. Design and Drawings.\n\nExplanation:\nThe Conceive phase in the CDIO framework (and similar design processes) focuses on identifying the problem, understanding context, and generating initial ideas. Activities like defining customer needs, considering enterprise strategy and regulations, and developing a business plan are all part of forming the initial concept and understanding the project's feasibility and scope. Design and drawings, however, are typically the output of the subsequent 'Design' phase, where detailed specifications and blueprints are created based on the concepts developed during the Conceive phase.",

            "answer": "The correct option is c. Communication of Results.\n\nExplanation:\nWhile 'Test and Evaluate' is a critical late stage where the design is refined and validated, the ultimate final step in many formal engineering design processes is the communication of the design, its performance, and findings to stakeholders. 'Prototype' is part of development, and 'Solution' is the outcome, not a stage. After a solution has been tested and evaluated, the results, recommendations, and finalized design must be effectively communicated to others (clients, manufacturing, etc.) to complete the design cycle for that iteration.",

            "answer": "The correct option is b. Define the Problem.\n\nExplanation:\nRegardless of the specific engineering design model (e.g., iterative, waterfall), the foundational first step is always to clearly understand and define the problem that needs to be solved. Without a well-defined problem, engineers cannot effectively set objectives, gather requirements, or embark on designing a suitable solution. The other options are later stages or outcomes of the process.",

            "answer": "**ADDIE Model Explanation**\n\nADDIE is a widely recognized and frequently used systematic instructional design model that provides a framework for developing effective learning and training programs. The acronym stands for five interconnected phases: Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation.\n\nEach phase has a specific purpose and contributes to the overall success of the learning solution. While often presented linearly, ADDIE is inherently iterative, allowing for feedback and revisions at any stage.\n\n**1. Analysis (A):**\nThis foundational phase involves identifying the target audience's needs, defining the problem, and establishing the learning objectives. Key activities include:\n*   Identifying the instructional problem.\n*   Analyzing learner characteristics (prior knowledge, skills, motivation).\n*   Determining available resources and constraints.\n*   Defining the goals and objectives for the instruction.\n*   Conducting a task analysis to break down complex skills.\n\n**2. Design (D):**\nIn this phase, the instructional strategies, content, activities, and assessment methods are planned. This is where the blueprint for the learning solution is created. Activities include:\n*   Developing learning objectives (measurable and specific).\n*   Outlining content, sequencing, and structure.\n*   Selecting instructional methods (e.g., lectures, hands-on, group work).\n*   Designing assessments (formative and summative) to measure learning.\n*   Creating a storyboard or detailed course outline.\n\n**3. Development (D):**\nThis phase involves the actual creation of the learning materials and activities based on the design specifications. This is where concepts become tangible. Activities include:\n*   Producing course content (text, multimedia, graphics).\n*   Building prototypes of interactive elements or simulations.\n*   Developing instructor guides and participant workbooks.\n*   Programming any necessary software or online modules.\n*   Conducting formative evaluations with a small group of learners (alpha/beta testing).\n\n**4. Implementation (I):**\nDuring this phase, the developed instruction is delivered to the target audience. This can involve facilitating training sessions, deploying e-learning courses, or integrating new systems. Activities include:\n*   Training instructors or facilitators.\n*   Preparing the learning environment.\n*   Deploying the course or program.\n*   Managing learner enrollment and progress.\n*   Providing technical support.\n\n**5. Evaluation (E):**\nThis final, but ongoing, phase assesses the effectiveness and efficiency of the instruction. Evaluation occurs throughout the ADDIE process (formative) and after implementation (summative) to determine if the learning objectives were met and to identify areas for improvement. Activities include:\n*   Collecting feedback from learners, instructors, and stakeholders.\n*   Analyzing assessment results and performance data.\n*   Measuring the impact of the training on performance or business goals.\n*   Revising and improving the instructional materials and delivery based on findings.\n\n**Conceptual Sketch of ADDIE (Descriptive):**\nImagine a circular flow diagram with 'Analysis' at the top, leading clockwise through 'Design', 'Development', 'Implementation', and finally 'Evaluation'. Arrows connect each stage to the next, but also include smaller feedback loops pointing back from later stages to earlier ones, emphasizing its iterative nature. A central arrow could represent the constant feedback and refinement inherent in the model.\n\n**Example Application: Developing a Training Program for New Software Engineers**\n*   **Analysis:** Determine that new hires lack specific skills in a proprietary software. Identify the target audience (recent CS graduates), their current skill level, and define objectives (e.g., by end of training, engineers can perform basic tasks in the software independently).\n*   **Design:** Outline a 2-week training curriculum, including modules on software architecture, coding standards, common operations, and troubleshooting. Design hands-on lab exercises and a final project.\n*   **Development:** Create presentation slides, detailed lab manuals, sample code, a simulated environment for practice, and a final assessment project description.\n*   **Implementation:** Conduct the 2-week training sessions for a cohort of new engineers, providing access to resources and support.\n*   **Evaluation:** Administer quizzes and evaluate the final project. Collect feedback from trainees and their managers. Analyze if engineers meet the performance objectives post-training. Use this data to refine the training program for future cohorts.",

            "answer": "**What is Ethics?**\n\nEthics is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct. It addresses questions of morality, such as how humans should live, what actions are justifiable, and what constitutes a good life. In a practical sense, ethics provides a framework for making decisions when faced with moral dilemmas, guiding individuals and groups towards actions that are considered fair, just, and beneficial.\n\n**Engineer's Code of Ethics:**\n\nAn Engineer's Code of Ethics is a formal statement of the moral principles and values that guide the professional conduct of engineers. These codes are typically developed by professional engineering societies to ensure that engineers uphold the highest standards of integrity, responsibility, and public welfare in their work. While specific codes may vary slightly between organizations, several fundamental principles are universally recognized. The primary purpose of a code of ethics is to:\n1.  **Protect the Public:** Ensure that engineering work serves the safety, health, and welfare of the public.\n2.  **Guide Professional Conduct:** Provide a clear set of guidelines for ethical decision-making.\n3.  **Promote Professionalism:** Uphold the reputation and integrity of the engineering profession.\n4.  **Resolve Ethical Dilemmas:** Offer a framework for addressing complex moral issues encountered in practice.\n\n**Key Principles Commonly Found in an Engineer's Code of Ethics:**\n\n1.  **Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public:** This is often considered the most fundamental principle. Engineers have a responsibility to design and build systems and products that do not pose undue risks to the public or the environment. This includes considering long-term impacts and potential hazards.\n\n2.  **Perform services only in areas of their competence:** Engineers should only undertake assignments for which they are qualified by education, training, or experience. They must be honest about their limitations and seek assistance from or refer clients to other qualified professionals when necessary.\n\n3.  **Issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner:** Engineers should be objective and truthful in all professional reports, statements, or testimony. They must avoid deceptive acts and not allow personal biases or external pressures to compromise their professional judgment.\n\n4.  **Act for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees:** Engineers owe loyalty to their employers and clients, treating their information confidentially and avoiding conflicts of interest. They must disclose any potential conflicts that might arise.\n\n5.  **Avoid deceptive acts:** This principle reinforces the importance of honesty and transparency. Engineers should not misrepresent their qualifications, falsify data, or engage in any form of dishonest behavior.\n\n6.  **Conduct themselves honorably, responsibly, ethically, and lawfully so as to enhance the honor, reputation, and usefulness of the profession:** Engineers are expected to uphold the dignity and integrity of their profession. This involves adhering to all applicable laws and regulations, promoting diversity, and treating colleagues and subordinates with respect.\n\n7.  **Continue their professional development throughout their careers:** The field of engineering is constantly evolving. Engineers have a responsibility to stay current with new technologies, methods, and ethical considerations through lifelong learning to maintain their competence and serve the public effectively.\n\nThese principles serve as a moral compass for engineers, ensuring that their technical expertise is consistently applied with a strong sense of social responsibility and ethical integrity.",
