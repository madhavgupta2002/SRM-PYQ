            "answer": "b) The study of the nature of being and existence in engineering\nOntology is a branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of being, becoming, existence, or reality. In engineering, it focuses on understanding what constitutes engineering entities, processes, and concepts, defining their fundamental properties and relationships.",

            "answer": "d) All of the above\nEpistemology of engineering design concerns the nature, sources, and validity of knowledge used in design. Engineering itself is fundamental, as it provides the technical and scientific knowledge. Psychology contributes through understanding human cognition, decision-making, and user behavior in design. Sociology contributes by considering the societal context, user needs, ethical implications, and cultural factors that influence design and its knowledge base. Therefore, all these disciplines significantly contribute.",

            "answer": "a) Realistic and Investigative\nIn the RIASEC model, 'Realistic' individuals are practical, hands-on, and enjoy working with tools, machines, and objects, which aligns with the tangible aspects of engineering. 'Investigative' individuals are analytical, intellectual, logical, and enjoy problem-solving and scientific inquiry, which is crucial for engineering research and design. These two types are strongly associated with engineering careers.",

            "answer": "b) Examining how knowledge is acquired and validated in engineering\nEpistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge. In engineering, its primary focus is to investigate the nature of engineering knowledge, how it is generated (e.g., through design, experimentation, modeling, experience), and how it is justified, verified, and accepted as reliable within the engineering community. This includes understanding the methods, assumptions, and limitations of engineering knowledge.",

It may include nodes representing market research data, customer needs, conceptual designs, and feasibility studies.\nContribution to Product Management: The ontological structure in the introduction phase helps product managers and engineers understand the initial requirements, constraints, and opportunities associated with a new product.\nGrowth Phase:\nOntological Structure: During the growth phase, the ontological structure may expand to include nodes representing scaling strategies, production processes, supply chain management, and quality control measures.\nContribution to Product Management: The ontological structure in the growth phase enables product managers to monitor and optimize production processes, respond to changing market demands, and identify opportunities for product differentiation\nMaturity Phase:\nOntological Structure: In the maturity phase, the ontological structure may emphasize nodes related to product optimization, cost reduction strategies, lifecycle management, and customer support services.\nDecline Phase:\nOntological Structure: During the decline phase, the ontological structure may focus on nodes related to product phase-out planning, inventory management, and disposition strategies for unsold inventory.\nContribution to Product Management: The ontological structure in the decline phase enables product managers to navigate end-of-life considerations, mitigate risks associated with declining sales, and responsibly manage product discontinuation.",

            "marks": 5,
            "answer": "In the 1950s, John Holland theorized that personality and work environment are measurable, and that the two should be matched in order to find a satisfying career. Holland's theory describes six basic personality types (RIASEC, described below). One type is typically dominant; an individual's top three types -- in order -- make up that person's Holland Code. The goal is to match an individual's code, or personality type, with his or her career.\n\n[The provided paper includes a diagram illustrating the six RIASEC types (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional) with brief descriptions for each, showing typical activities and values. For instance, 'Realistic' involves practical, hands-on, physical activities like building or repairing objects. 'Investigative' involves analytical, intellectual problem-solving and scientific inquiry. These types help in understanding alignment with engineering roles.]",

            "marks": 15,
            "answer": "Design as activity is related to the conceptualization (pre-execution) stages of making new products. Design as activity is usually further organized under \"art versus technique\" or \"form versus function\". Fine art, industrial design (applied art), architecture and engineering are typical examples of design as activity.\nDesign as planning is related to the systematic mental processes prior to actions and conceptualization (pre-execution) stages for planning composing and decision making. While design as activity is more related to professional endeavors like art or engineering, design as planning is more affiliated with management of a wide range of fields from business to military and from hospitals to academy.\nDesign as epistemology is related to the synthetic methodologies needed for the mental apprehension of appropriateness for change. Design epistemology is distinct from analytic methodologies, which is crucial to develop scientific initiatives. Taking as a reference the proposed four-dimensional model and the epistemology of design briefly discussed in the previous section, the remainder of the talk analyses the epistemology of engineering in light of the four key questions of the philosophy of knowledge: the ontological, the epistemological, the methodological, and the axiological questions.\nhow they differ from other forms of knowledge acquisition in engineering.\nInterdisciplinary Nature\nIterative and Reflective Process\nHuman-Centered Design\nEmphasis on Communication and Collaboration.",
