            "question_text": "Explain briefly on Non-Motivated functions of art.",
            "marks": 8,
            "answer": "Non-motivated functions of art are those that are intrinsic to the human experience, existing without a specific, external, or deliberate purpose. They are a fundamental aspect of human creativity and expression, deeply ingrained in our psychological and emotional makeup. Unlike motivated functions of art, which serve practical, social, or political ends (like communication, entertainment, or healing), non-motivated art arises from an innate human need to create, explore, and imagine.\n\nKey characteristics of non-motivated functions include:\n\n*   **Expression of Imagination:** Art can be a direct outflow of an individual's inner thoughts, feelings, and fantasies, providing a means to visualize and materialize the abstract without necessarily aiming for external understanding or utility.\n*   **Basic Human Instinct:** The urge to make things, to decorate, to give form to material, or to structure sound and movement, appears to be a fundamental human trait, often seen in play and exploratory behaviors.\n*   **Emotional Release and Catharsis:** Creating or experiencing art can serve as a channel for processing emotions, providing psychological relief or a sense of spiritual connection without a predefined goal.\n*   **Exploration and Discovery:** Art can be a way of experimenting with materials, forms, and ideas, leading to new insights or purely aesthetic experiences that are valued for their own sake.\n\nEssentially, non-motivated art is art for art's sake, emerging from an internal drive rather than an external demand or objective. It highlights the purely aesthetic, spiritual, or expressive dimensions of human creativity.",

            "marks": 5,
            "answer": "The relationship between Arts, Mathematics, Science, Technology, and Engineering (often summarized as STEAM) is deeply interconnected and synergistic, forming the bedrock of human innovation and progress:\n\n1.  **Mathematics:** Serves as the fundamental language and tool for all other disciplines. It provides the logical framework, quantitative methods, and abstract concepts necessary for scientific theories, technological design, and engineering calculations. Without mathematics, the precise modeling and analysis required for science and engineering would be impossible.\n2.  **Science:** Is the systematic pursuit of knowledge about the natural world through observation, experimentation, and theoretical explanation. It aims to understand *why* things happen. Scientific discoveries provide the foundational principles and theories (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology) that technology harnesses and engineering applies. For instance, understanding electromagnetism (science) led to electric motors (technology) and power grids (engineering).\n3.  **Technology:** Is the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, often involving the creation of tools, machines, systems, and methods to solve problems or improve human life. Technology is the 'how' \u2013 it's the bridge between pure scientific understanding and practical implementation. While science discovers, technology invents and refines. For example, scientific understanding of semiconductors led to microchip technology.\n4.  **Engineering:** Is the creative application of scientific principles, mathematical methods, and technological tools to design, build, and maintain structures, machines, systems, and processes. Engineers take scientific theories and technological capabilities and transform them into functional, safe, and efficient solutions for society. They are problem-solvers who bridge the gap between abstract concepts and tangible realities, using mathematical models and scientific insights to develop new technologies or improve existing ones.\n5.  **Arts:** Traditionally seen as distinct, the arts (visual arts, performing arts, literature) play a crucial role in fostering creativity, critical thinking, communication, and humanistic understanding. In a STEAM context, art influences design aesthetics, user experience, and imaginative problem-solving. It can inspire engineers, inform technological interfaces, and help communicate complex scientific ideas to broader audiences. The 'A' in STEAM recognizes that creativity and design thinking, central to the arts, are vital for innovation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\n\nIn essence, mathematics provides the language, science provides the knowledge, technology provides the tools, engineering applies them to create solutions, and the arts infuse creativity, empathy, and design into the entire process, creating a holistic approach to understanding and shaping the world.",
